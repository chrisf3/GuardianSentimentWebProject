world/2001/jun/22/usa.saudiarabia,Iranians 'plotted' US bomb attack,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/22/usa.saudiarabia,"Fourteen men - 13 Saudis and one Lebanese - were indicted by the US government in their absence yesterday with the terrorist bombing at an American military base in Saudi Arabia which killed 19 servicemen in 1996. The truck bomb, which injured more than 300 others, exploded outside Khobar Towers, an apartment block in Dharan where the servicemen were living. The list of thse charged - announced by the US attorney general, John Ashcroft, and the FBI director, Louis Freeh - includes the leader of Saudi Hizbullah and prominent members of Hizbullah's military wing. Mr Ashcroft said the indictment explained that members of the Iranian government ""inspired, supported and supervised"" members of Saudi Hizbullah, and that the terror ists ""reported surveillance activities to Iranian officials"". The indictment list is more significant for the names it omits than those it includes. Although Mr Ashcroft said Iranians were behind the conspiracy, and warned that more indictments were possible, the omission of Iranians from the list represented a climbdown by the FBI and, in particular, its outgoing director, Mr Freeh, who has made the investigation a personal crusade. For years the bureau's agents privately insisted that they had enough information to indict senior members of Iranian intelligence, and possibly even the country's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In a list of suspects Mr Freeh handed to the White House recnetly, there were reported to be several high-ranking Iranian officials. Brigadier Ahmad Sherifi, a senior officer in the Revolutionary Guard, was a leading suspect. Ahmed Vahidi, the head of the Guard's al-Quds (Jerusalem) force - responsible for covert external operations, has also been frequently mentioned. New Yorker magazine recently quoted prosecution witnesses as saying Brig Sherifi had recruited them as terrorists, saying he was acting on behalf of Ayatollah Khamenei. As the head of the special operations committee of the Tehran government, would have had direct command of all al-Quds operations. The charges, announced a few days before the fifth anniversary of the bombing, are the culmination of an FBI investigation which was continually muddied by foreign policy manoeuvring and Washington intrigue. In the New Yorker, Mr Freeh blamed the Clinton administration for putting the brakes on the investigation in the interests of rapprochement with the reformist government of Mohammad Khatami in Iran. Outgoing officials from the Clinton administration, said Mr Freeh, never had the conclusive proof necessary to press charges against Iranian officials. The Bush administration is similarly reluctant to jeopardise relations with Iran. The president and the vice-president are closely linked with the oil industry which has lobbied for years for the easing of sanctions against Iran to enable US corporations to bid for oil deals. The Saudi government has also played a role in holding back charges against Iranian officials, in its anxiety to foster better relations with the unpredictable Islamic regime. In April Riyadh signed a security agreement with Tehran to combat terrorism and crime. It excluded extradition clause. Several of the suspects from Saudi Hizbullah named yesterday live or have spent time in Iran.",2001-06-22T00:48:37Z,"{'polarity': 0.04889842300556587, 'subjectivity': 0.3874330035044321}",0.3874330035044321

The blast occurred 45 minutes after police received the first of four telephone calls warning that a bomb would go off in the city of Logrono, about 160 miles north of Madrid, the news agency Efe said. Efe said that the caller claimed to speak on behalf of Eta, which has claimed the killings of 800 people since it launched its violent campaign for Basque independence in 1968. The bombing comes just two days before the US president, George Bush, is scheduled to arrive in Madrid at the start of a European tour. The attack coincided with festivities in Logrono in honour of Saint Bernabe, patron saint of the city. Windows in offices, shops and cars shattered and several people were injured by flying glass, Efe said.

The device was thrown at Riaz Ahmad's house on Denton Lane, Chadderton, Oldham, in the early hours of this morning. No one was injured but the house was extensively damaged. A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester police said: ""At 0335 hours this morning, what is believed to be a petrol bomb was thrown at an address on Denton Lane in Chadderton. ""Extensive damage was caused but there were no injuries. The matter is being treated as racially motivated and arson."" Police are appealing for witnesses to the attack. The incident follows a weekend of race riots in Oldham which were the worst Britain has seen for 15 years. Richard Knowles, leader of Oldham council, has written to the prime minister asking for urgent help in dealing with the aftermath of the clashes. The letter, also signed by chief executive Andrew Kilburn and Greater Manchester police chief constable David Wilmot, said there should be an early, ""wide-ranging review"" of the circumstances surrounding the disturbances.

world/2001/jun/25/israel,Phone bomb kills man wanted by Israel,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/25/israel,"A Palestinian wanted by the Israelis in connection with bomb attacks was killed yesterday when a booby-trapped telephone exploded in a square in Nablus, on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The Palestinians have blamed Israel for the death of Osama Jawabri but the army, in line with its usual policy on intelligence matters, has refused to comment. Mr Jawabri, 29, had gone to use a public phone near his home in the centre of Nablus. ""I heard a big explosion and I thought we were being shelled,"" said Bilal Iran, the owner of a nearby shoe shop. ""I found a man's body on the ground, with cuts all over his body."" A boy of four and his two-year-old sister were slightly injured by flying fragments from the explosion. According to Palestinians in Nablus, Mr Jawabri was a member of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a group that has claimed responsibility for the killings of Jewish settlers. The blast appears to mark a return by Israel to its assassination policy, which it had stopped after international pressure. It came just hours before the prime minister, Ariel Sharon, left for Washington to discuss the ceasefire with President George Bush. Mr Sharon stopped off in London last night to discuss the European Union's position - which Israelis claim is too pro-Palestinian - with the prime minister, Tony Blair. Marwan Barghouti, a prominent member of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement and one of the leaders of the intifada, threatened vengeance for the killing. ""With this assassination, Sharon has opened the gates of hell for the Israelis,"" he said yesterday. The Israeli army is believed to have been responsible for a similar booby-trapped telephone explosion that killed a Palestinian in April. Israel last week handed the Palestinian Authority a list of about a dozen Palestinians it wanted arrested or re-arrested. The Palestinian Authority has refused to act on its demands. The killing yesterday follows the deaths of two Israeli soldiers, Aviv Izak and Ophir Kit, both 19, at the hands of a suicide bomber, Ismail Maoussabie, 27, in Gaza on Friday. Those killings ended a rare 36 hours in which no Palestinian shots were fired. Since a US-sponsored ceasefire began on June 13, eight Palestinians and six Israelis have been killed. Israeli diplomats said Mr Sharon will be exploring with Mr Bush how to move beyond that ceasefire.",2001-06-25T01:18:57Z,"{'polarity': 0.004629629629629632, 'subjectivity': 0.22037037037037036}",0.22037037037037036
world/2001/apr/08/saudiarabia,Saudi bomb case Briton 'tortured',World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/08/saudiarabia,"A British man who confessed on television to a spate of bombings in Saudi Arabia has been rushed to hospital amid claims of psychological torture. Sandy Mitchell, from Kirkintilloch in Scotland, confessed in February to the bombings, in which one man was killed and five others injured. Last week, a prominent Saudi dissident said Mitchell and two other westerners who had confessed were innocent of the offences and that the Saudi government knew the bombs were planted by Islamic militants. Dr Saad al-Fagih, director of the Movement for Islamic Reform, who made the claims, said his sources in Saudi Arabia had informed him that Mitchell had been moved to the security forces hospital in central Riyadh. The Foreign Office later confirmed that Mitchell had been taken into hospital for 'a check up' and that the Saudi government said his health was fine. The Foreign Office said that the British embassy in Riyadh was making further inquiries over the weekend. Dr al-Fagih, whose movement campaigns for the peaceful reform of Saudi Arabia, said that a second British prisoner, Gary O'Nions (also known as Gary Dixon) had also been admitted to hospital. O'Nions, who is in prison on alcohol charges, was extradited from the United Arab Emirates last month. Al-Fagih says his sources believe Mitchell's co-accused, Belgian Raaf Schifte, has been admitted to the Prince Sultan Centre, a Riyadh cardiac clinic. It is already known that the third man who confessed, Scots-Canadian William Sampson, is being treated after a heart attack. Sources in Saudi Arabia described Mitchell as looking 'very, very frightened' when he was transferred to hospital and 'almost like a refugee fleeing a war'.",2001-04-08T01:08:44Z,"{'polarity': 0.07734848484848485, 'subjectivity': 0.25901515151515153}",0.25901515151515153
world/2001/may/25/israel4,Sharon calls for ceasefire after suicide bomb,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/25/israel4,"The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, has again called for a Palestinian ceasefire, in a move dismissed by Palestinians as a propaganda ploy, coming just hours after three people were killed by a car bomb Mr Sharon told a news conference: ""I repeat a call and hope that the head of the Palestinian authority [Yasser Arafat] and the Palestinian authority will finally instruct and call for a ceasfire,"" Mr Sharon first called for a truce on Tuesday night, in the wake of the publication of the US-led Mitchell report into the violence which urged both sides to end hostilities and called on the Israeli's to halt settlement of disputed areas. The car exploded today shortly before 2pm local time (11.00am GMT) near a bus in the main bus station of the central Israeli town of Hadera, just north of Tel Aviv. It follows an earlier explosion today in Gaza, when a truck was blown up by Israeli forces, killing the driver. Hamas later claimed responsiblity for that attempted suicide bomb. Up to 39 people were injured in today's explosion, on a day when Israel is already grieving 21 wedding guests killed when a building collapsed last night. Police suspect that all of the dead in the blast were Palestinian suicide bombers who set off a device in the car. Lebanese television has reported that the Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the bombing. The Hadera police chief, Dudu Harel, told Israel Radio: ""We have three bodies which we believe are apparently the terrorists. But I emphasise it is only a first estimate."" The explosion came a week after a suicide bombing at a shopping mall in the northern coastal town of Netanya. In that blast, five Israelis and the assailant were killed. Palestinian Islamic militant groups have carried out car bombings against Israeli targets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and in Israel with greater frequency since the start of a Palestinian uprising in September.

world/2001/apr/06/israel,Israeli phone bomb kills militant,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/06/israel,"Israel stepped up reprisals against the Palestinians yesterday by assassinating a commander of the militant Islamic Jihad group with an explosive device planted in a public phone box. Islamic Jihad, which has been responsible for many bombings in Israel, threatened to avenge his death. A similar Israeli booby trap in 1996 was followed by a wave of suicide bombings. The killing in the West Bank town of Jenin came only hours after Israeli soldiers shot up a convoy carrying a senior Palestinian negotiator, Mohammed Dahlan, back from peace talks. He escaped injury, but one of his bodyguards was shot in the leg and two others were injured when their vehicle overturned. Mr Dahlan, a member of the inner circle of the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, is the most senior Palestinian yet to be on the receiving end of Israeli fire. The Palestinians claimed it was a botched assassination attempt while the Israelis insisted the Palestinians opened fire first. The Israeli army promised an investigation. After a relatively quiet Wednesday that saw political initiatives from both sides, the hardline Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, resorted to the iron fist yesterday. In addition to the violence that also saw the Israelis kill Ahmed Mahmoud al-Atar, a 15-year-old Palestinian who was throwing stones, the Israeli government threatened to add to the already deteriorating situation by inviting tenders for 700 new houses for Jewish settlers in the predominantly Palestinian West Bank. Israeli peace campaigners condemned the announcement, while the United States called the move provocative and inflammatory. Using language much stronger than in previous statements on Jewish settlements, state department spokesman Richard Boucher said: ""Continuing settlement activity by Israel does risk further inflaming an already volatile situation in the region. ""This is provocative and we have consistently encouraged both sides to refrain from provocative acts."" The Islamic Jihad commander, Iyad al-Hardan, 25, was killed instantly when the phone exploded after he inserted a phone card. He had been released from a Palestinian Authority prison after the uprising began in September, but was re-arrested by Palestinian police six weeks ago. He was regularly allowed out to make calls. A Palestinian Authority source said: ""Israel is responsible for this assassination operation by putting explosive materials inside the telephone."" Israeli officials declined to comment but Israeli radio reported that Mr Hardan had been liquidated by the Israeli security forces and that he was responsible for a series of attacks on Israelis. The shooting incident involving Mr Dahlan, who is head of security in Gaza, took place at the Israel-Gaza border as he was returning from talks in Tel Aviv with Israeli security chiefs about renewing joint security arrangements which were ended by the Palestinian uprising. ""This Israeli ambush was another assassination attack against us,"" Mr Dahlan said. Nerves tend to be fraught at the border, especially in the darkness, and soldiers, police and security men on both sides are trigger-happy. An Israeli army spokesman, Lieutenant Olivier Rafowicz, said, following a preliminary investigation, that the Palestinians ""opened fire from the first Jeep, from the back right-hand window and then Israeli soldiers fired back at the source from the Jeep"". He said: ""This [assassination] allegation is childish and baseless. We were sitting with him and other security people to try to resume peace talks. There is no logic [in trying to assassinate him].""

world/2001/mar/28/israel6,Second suicide bomb hits Israel,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/28/israel6,"A second Palestinian suicide bomber attacked Israel this morning, killing two teenagers in the north of the country one day after a Palestinian man blew himself up outside a bus in Jerusalem. This morning's explosion happened as a group of Israeli teenagers were waiting for a ride to school. The bomber and two students were killed and four people were hurt, one critically. The Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for the blast, and said seven more bombers were ready to strike. Two further bombs were discovered and safely exploded in the Israeli towns of Netanya and Petah Tikvah. The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, called for an emergency session of his security cabinet this afternoon and has vowed to avenge the recent killings. Police have said they expected an increase in the pace of bombings during the Arab League summit which was to conclude in Jordan later today, but the Israeli government has been reluctant to respond during the summit. However, Israel's police commissioner said little more could be done to prevent suicide attacks. ""We are faced with a very big offensive of the terrorist organisations to carry out attacks,"" said the police commissioner, Shlomo Aharonishki. ""The last few days show that in spite of all our stepped-up efforts ... they succeeded in getting in."" Today's blast went off shortly after 7.30am (5.30am GMT) in the parking lot of a gas station. ""I saw three young fellows lying on the ground. They looked in really bad shape,"" said a customer at the station, who was only identified by his first name, Maoz. ""Another was wounded, but was still standing up."" White plastic bags covered the three bodies lying on the ground near the gas pumps. Troops sealed off the area, searching for additional explosives. Earlier this month, four people, including a Palestinian suicide bomber, were killed in a blast in Netanya. Yesterday, Palestinian militants carried out back-to-back attacks in Jerusalem, including a bombing near a bus that killed the assailant and injured more than two dozen by-standers. In a phone call to a Western news agency, Hamas claimed responsibility for today's blast and yesterday's suicide bombing in Jerusalem. In the West Bank town of Hebron, an 11-year-old Palestinian boy, Mahmoud Darawish, was killed in an exchange of fire yesterday with Israeli forces at a refugee camp. Seven Palestinian-owned cars and five Palestinian shops were torched yesterday in Hebron's Abu Sneineh neighbourhood, apparently by Jewish settlers avenging the killing of a 10-month-old Israeli girl earlier this week by Palestinian snipers.

world/2001/jun/02/israel1,Suicide bomb massacre at Israeli disco,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/02/israel1,"At least 17 people were killed and scores wounded last night when a suicide bomber infiltrated a popular beach-front disco in Tel Aviv and blew himself up in the middle of the crowds waiting to get in. Israeli television said 17 people, many of them 16-year-olds, had been killed and 85 injured, seven critically, in the explosion at the Dolphinarium, inflicting the heaviest toll on Israelis in five years. Officials called it one of the most inhuman attacks in Israel's history. After the last major suicide bomb attack in Netanya, Israel responded with F-16 fighter aircraft. At the least Israel's hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon, is expected to abandon the self-imposed ceasefire which Israelis say has operated over the past two weeks to help talks get under way. The Israel security cabinet will go into emergency session today as the national unity government came under enormous pressure to deliver a devastating military response. ""It's impossible to go on with the ceasefire after an attack like this on our children,"" said Roni Milo, former mayor of Tel Aviv. ""We have to strike back very hard so that the terrorists know they cannot succeed."" The Islamic Jihad militant group, which claimed responsibility for the attack, said this would be the first of five such suicide attacks in Israel. This area is almost sacred ground for Tel Avivians who see the beach as a symbol of their secular lifestyle and desire to lead normal lives. As Israeli politicians were rushing to blame Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, President George Bush urged the Palestinian leader to declare a ceasefire. ""I call upon Chairman Arafat to condemn this act and to call for an immediate ceasefire,"" Mr Bush said. The bomber struck at about 11.45pm local time, as he stood with a group of young people waiting to get into the club. ""I was about to enter, and suddenly I looked in the direction of the blast and saw people thrown backward,"" said Dudi Nachum, 21. ""I saw parts of a brain, things I have never seen before. It was terrible."" Most of the patrons were Russian immigrants. ""The people who got hurt were in essence children. They were aged 16 or 17,"" said Eli Yedid, a bouncer at the club. A radio reporter on the scene described puddles of blood on the pavement. A witness told Reuters: ""I can see dead people, and many wounded people. It's a big mess."" A witness named Avi told the radio: ""I entered a nightclub and suddenly there was a flash and a boom that threw me backward."" As 30 ambulances wailed to the scene, helicopters hovered overhead. Television pictures showed young people staggering into hospital spattered with blood or lying on stretchers. The attack capped a week in which the Palestinian uprising had struck ever more directly at Israeli civilians inside their borders, as well as in the occupied territories. Within the space of 72 hours, four Jewish settlers were killed in the West Bank in drive-by shootings by Palestinian gun men. In Jerusalem there were two car bombs. The stepping up of the attacks by Islamic militant groups has deeply demoralised Israelis and seems aimed at sabotaging whatever faint hopes there are for a genuine ceasefire from the latest bout of US diplomacy. Defence minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, called the blast ""one of the most cruel and inhuman terror attacks that we have witnessed in Israel"". The Palestinian parliament's Speaker, Ahmed Qureia, said: ""There is no way to put an end to this cycle of violence as long as the Israeli government is not responding to the international community's calls or invitation to put an end to the aggression it is practising.""",2001-06-02T01:52:53Z,"{'polarity': -0.02976190476190476, 'subjectivity': 0.4172619047619048}",0.4172619047619048
world/2001/may/04/michaelhoward.stevenmorris,British woman killed by own bomb,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/04/michaelhoward.stevenmorris,"A British woman with close ties to the Athens underworld was killed in the Greek capital yesterday when a homemade bomb she was carrying in her BMW accidentally exploded. Detectives believe Susan Aristides, who was brought up in west London but had lived in Athens for 20 years after marrying a Greek Australian, was on her way to plant the device in a revenge attack after a spate of gangland killings. Aristides, 48, whose maiden name was Weymouth, was thrown from the car by the blast, which rocked the southern suburb of Voula in the early hours of the morning. The mother-of-two was wearing black gloves and had cotton wool plugged in her ears. The bomb had been placed near the handbrake and a remote control device was found in a bag. Detectives believe she accidentally set the bomb off when she stopped to check it or to move it. It is also possible that her pet rottweiler, which was in the car, sat on the detonator or bit it. Initially there were fears that the explosion could be connected to the visit of the Pope today, which has led to protests by Greek Orthodox extremists. It was also thought she may have been targeted by the terrorist group November 17, which claimed responsibility for the murder of a British military attache, Brigadier Stephen Saunders, last year. But when police found a stash of bombmaking equipment at her penthouse home they dismissed the idea that terrorists were to blame. Instead, to the amazement of the woman's family and friends in London who had no idea of her connections, police began investigating her links with gangs suspected of running protection rackets in cabaret nightclubs A police source said: ""It looks like she was carrying it somewhere when it went off. But at the moment we don't know why it went off or what the target was going to be."" She was known by police for her friendship with the Grigorakos clan, a leading criminal family in Athens, which runs drugs and extortion rackets in hotels and nightclubs along the capital's south-eastern coast. The gang's ""godfather"" was Vassillis Grigorakos, a kingpin of the capital's cocaine trade. His son Niko ran a private army that carried out murders and beatings. Both were killed last summer in a gangland war, and Aristides was photographed comforting relatives at the scene of Niko's murder. Yesterday British relatives expressed shock at her extraordinary end as they tried to puzzle out how an ordinary girl from a decent west London family had become a friend of a criminal clan. She grew up on the Wesley Estate, north Acton, and attended the local state school, where she was considered a bright girl. When she was 16, however, her mother, Myra Bermingham, emigrated with Susan and her other three children to Australia. Susan got back in touch with her father five years ago and introduced him to her two adult sons, Steven and Paul. She showed him photos of her sumptuous Athens home and said she had married a Greek Australian but had separated from him. She was vague about what she did, telling her father, David, only that she ""ran her own business"". Mr Weymouth said when he heard on the radio that a British woman had been killed in Athens he told his wife: ""I hope that's not Susan. I couldn't believe it when they said her name. I last heard from her when she sent an Easter card. I can't begin to understand what has happened."" Since the collapse of the Soviet bloc, organised crime in the Balkans has flourished and Greece, which boasts the region's most vibrant economy, has been a natural target. Many syndicates with international connections have also been attracted by the potential for profit from the expected business boom ahead of the 2004 Olympic Games. A major crackdown on Athens criminal gangs was announced last summer after a wave of bloodletting among gangland leaders provoked fierce criticism of police, who were accused of being happy to stand by as the godfathers wiped each other out. Five gangland bosses were killed as rivals exploded bombs in homes and cars, with little regard for innocent bystanders. The police were also accused of incompetency and corruption. Now they believe that most of the crime bosses are either dead or in prison. A bill to counter organised crime and terrorism is expected to become law by the end of the month.",2001-05-04T01:16:59Z,"{'polarity': 0.022844827586206894, 'subjectivity': 0.3314655172413793}",0.3314655172413793

Santos Santamaria was killed by flying shrapnel while trying to clear people from the area where Eta had planted a car bomb. Three other officers were slightly injured. The car had been placed in front of the Montecarlo Hotel near the seafront at Roses. A few hours later bomb disposal experts exploded a car 250 miles south at the Gandia resort, near Valencia, which contained a 50kg bomb. The second car bomb was parked in front of the Hotel Riviera in Gandia, which was not due to open until Easter. Police evacuated residents from a nearby block of flats and diners at four restaurants. In both cases a caller claiming to be from Eta had warned that the bombs were set to explode. Police said the Roses bomb had exploded seven minutes before the time given by the caller and that the Eta unit responsible for both bombs was probably based in France. The bombs sparked anger from separatists in Catalonia, who said violence by Eta had become an obstacle in their own fight for independence.

But in a letter published yesterday in the Houston Chronicle, McVeigh stuck to his earlier account that he single-handedly planted the bomb outside the Alfred P Murrah federal building which killed 168 people. He ridiculed the conspiracy theories surrounding the bombing, the worst terrorist attack on US soil. The justice department said the latest bundle of documents had been found in the FBI's Baltimore field office and included seven files containing an unknown number of pages. The new discovery added to the bureau's embarrassment less than a week after it handed over boxes of evidence, including 3,000 pages of documents, photographs and tapes which should have been presented before McVeigh's trial four years ago. The discovery of the evidence led to the postponement of McVeigh's execution until next month. Justice department officials have blamed the oversight on outdated computer software used to run the FBI's database, and insist that the newly unearthed evidence has no bearing on the guilt of Mr McVeigh, or his co-defendant Terry Nichols, who helped him assemble the explosives. A friend of the two men, Michael Fortier, is also serving 12 years for failing to warn the authorities about the bomb. The evidence that was delivered to the lawyers last week included statements in which some witnesses said they saw a man - known in the casefile as ""John Doe No 2"" - with Mr McVeigh on the day of the bombing. The original federal charge in the bombing named Timothy McVeigh, Terry Nichols and ""others unknown"" but after national manhunt, the FBI declared that no one else was involved. Though Mr McVeigh also denies the existence of co-conspirators, sceptics, including his former lawyer, Stephen Jones, are unconvinced. ""Contrary to Tim's statements, there were at least six and as many as eight conspirators,"" Mr Jones told the magazine US News and World Report. ""Based on the things he told me, I feel I can now reveal this."" However, in his letter sent to the Houston Chronicle from his cell on federal death row in Indiana, Mr McVeigh disowned the lawyer: ""Jones has been thoroughly discredited, so I'm not going to break a sweat refuting his outlandish claims point by point,"" he wrote. ""The truth is on my side."" The hunt for John Doe No 2 began when employees at a body shop and car hire firm in Junction City, Kansas, told investigators that McVeigh was with a stocky, dark-skinned man on April 17, 1995, when he rented the lorry used in the blast. Witnesses gave a similar description of a man seen with Mr McVeigh in a grocery the same evening. The day before the blast McVeigh and Nichols were seen at a diner with a man described by a witness as ""looking more Hawaiian, like somebody who worked out."" And on the morning of the blast, April 19, a manager of a tyre shop said McVeigh and a ""dark-skinned man"" stopped to ask directions. The day before the bombing, a car mechanic called Charles Farley saw a group of five men standing around a Ryder truck, a brown car, a green and white van, and a green flatbed lorry, near the Kansas lake where McVeigh said he and Nichols put the bomb together. Mr Farley said the green lorry was loaded with white bags of powder he thought was ammonium nitrate fertiliser, the same typed used in the bomb. A year earlier, an estate agent in Missouri said that men fitting the descriptions of McVeigh and Nichols and a third man calling himself Robert Jacques had come to his office trying to buy land ""in the middle of nowhere"" preferably with caves on the property. He said Mr Jacques had done most of the talking. As a result of the FBI's belated discovery of evidence in the case, McVeigh's execution, due to take place this morning, was put off until June 11. He and his lawyers are studying the documents before deciding whether to file an appeal against his death sentence.",2001-05-16T01:41:28Z,"{'polarity': -0.007797903850535441, 'subjectivity': 0.3419998860788335}",0.3419998860788335
world/2001/jun/20/spain.gilestremlett,Spain foils Eta plot to bomb Plymouth ferry,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/20/spain.gilestremlett,"Spanish police said yesterday they had foiled a plan by the armed Basque separatist group Eta to sink a ferry bound for Plymouth from the northern port of Santander by driving a car bomb on to one of its decks. The ferry Val de Loire, which can carry 2,140 passengers, was among the potential targets lined up by a two-man Eta bombing team captured by anti-terrorist police last week. Jesus Maria Goikoetxea and Premin Sampedro, were arrested in the northern Spanish town of Mondragon. A search of their homes uncovered 35kg of dynamite, maps of Santander and details of the 32,000-tonne Val de Loire's sailing times. The ship, owned by Brittany Ferries, makes twice-weekly trips between the ports and is usually full during the summer. The two men have since been charged with planting a car bomb that exploded in the centre of Logrono on June 10. Spanish government officials yesterday tried to play down the danger to British tourists, claiming the ferry was just one of various targets being considered by the Eta unit, known as the Xoxua commando. They said Eta had not worked out a way to get the bomb on board and only intended to ""scare"" tourists rather than kill them. ""They did not have a specific plan for attacking the ferry. I imagine, however, that they had not collected information on it for innocent reasons,"" a government source said. In briefings to Spanish journalists, however, anti-terrorist police said they were sure the Xoxua commando had been intent on exploding a bomb on the Val de Loire and sinking it. ""Police are convinced the aim was to plant the bomb in the ferry's car deck, send a warning so the vessel could be evacuated and then sink it at the dockside,"" El Pais newspaper reported yesterday. The plan would have required precision timing. Eta usually gives only a few minutes warning before exploding bombs controlled by timers. The Val de Loire's 130 crew may not have been left with much time to evacuate passengers. The 540 vehicles on board the vessel would probably have been left to sink. This is not the first time that Eta has put passenger ferries on its list of potential targets. Police last year discovered a car bomb in the northern town of Benabarre which had been due to be driven on to a ferry travelling from the eastern port of Valencia to Ibiza. That attack was foiled by chance, when the car broke down and had to be abandoned. Police found that it had been packed with 100 kg of explosives, twice the amount normally used in Eta bombs. Brittany Ferries said yesterday it was trying to contact Spanish authorities to get more information on the Eta commando. It could not say whether it would boost security on the Val de Loire. ""Brittany Ferries is glad they have been caught,"" spokeswoman Sarah Hurley said. Police in Santander, which is close to the Basque country, said they could not reveal the security measures taken there but said undercover anti-ter rorist units often blitzed the city for signs of Eta activity. ""All cities in northern Spain have extra security,"" a spokeswoman said. Security in the port area had been tight since Eta attached a mine to a Spanish navy patrol vessel in Santander 15 years ago, she added. P&amp;O Portsmouth runs a twice-weekly service between Plymouth and the Basque city of Bilbao on Britain's largest ferry, the 37,500 ton Pride of Bilbao which can carry 2,500 passengers. The company said it was in continuous contact with Spain's guardia civil over port security at Bilbao. Eta carries out regular campaigns against tourist targets. These are usually designed to damage property rather than people. It exploded a bomb in the north-eastern resort town of Roses in March, killing a police officer. A second bomb was found in the resort of Denia, on the Mediterranean seaboard. An Eta bomb that exploded three years ago at Reus air port, eastern Spain, injured 35 tourists, including 24 Britons. Eta warned this year of ""undesirable consequences"" for tourists in Spain but its campaigns have not prevented the country becoming the world's number three holiday destination, after France and the US. Police said the Xoxua commando had orders to operate across northern Spain and to try to avoid civilian casualties.",2001-06-20T01:54:40Z,"{'polarity': 0.05792548500881835, 'subjectivity': 0.34572140822140823}",0.34572140822140823
world/2001/apr/23/saudiarabia,Doubts grow over Saudi bomb confession,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/23/saudiarabia,"When Sandy Mitchell appeared on Saudi television to confess his involvement in bombings and murder, his family and friends said he was drugged - he had been set up by a callous regime. It was an understandable reaction: Mr Mitchell is a kind of fly-guy, a hospitable technician and alcohol bootlegger with friends in high places. He is the sort of man who skates on the edge of trouble, but premeditated murder? Difficult to believe. Mr Mitchell, however, is facing public beheading in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh. As yet he has been charged with nothing. No date has been set for his trial, he has had only limited access to British consular officials, and no Saudi lawyer has been engaged. Yet, publicly at least, the Saudis are taking a hard line. Mr Mitchell and his co-accused - Canadian William Sampson and Belgian Raf Schyvens - have confessed to two car bombings, the endgame of a supposedly bitter feud over the control of illicit alcohol. Under sharia law their penalty is execution and the Saudi interior minister, Prince Nayef, has hinted he believes they should pay the price. Explosions continue But as diplomats juggle Saudi oil and trade interests with the necessity of having their nationals tried or released, doubts are emerging about the feasibility of Mr Mitchell's confession and the alcohol feud story. Although the alleged perpetrators of the Saudi bombing campaign are in prison, explosions have continued, the latest only three weeks ago. British survivors of one bomb attack said they had difficulty believing these men were guilty. A leading Saudi dissident said Islamic fundamentalists, opposed to the influx of westerners and the Saudi royal family's involvement in the illicit alcohol trade, were responsible for the bombings: Mr Mitchell and his co-accused were merely stooges, framed to convey the impression of stability in an oppressive country where Islamic rebellion was growing, albeit in isolated pockets. On December 17 last year, Mr Mitchell, 44, from Kirkintilloch near Glasgow, was arrested in Riyadh for suspected alcohol offences. To the expat community, his involvement in alcohol was an open secret. For a while he had supplemented his income as chief anaesthetic technician at the security forces hospital in Riyadh with a profitable sideline as owner of the Celtic Corner. He had sold the pub a year previously, but still kept a hand in alcohol. In a country where westerners live in compounds, where the boredom is as oppressive as the heat, the habit of selling whisky at £120 a bottle is difficult to break. Besides, Mr Mitchell counted police officials and members of the Saudi royal family among his friends. He could usually pull a few strings to get himself - and others - out of a scrape. Despite this, things had been getting tough in the alcohol trade. Only a few months earlier, Mr Mitchell had helped his friend, Gary Dixon, owner of the biggest illicit bar in Saudi Arabia, escape across the desert to Dubai. After a crackdown by the mutawwa, the religious police, Mr Dixon's wife, Mary, was already in jail. The jailing had surprised everyone. The expats embroiled in the drinks trade believed the involvement of the royal family left them immune to the mutawwa. ""The main source [of alcohol] is the royal family,"" said Mrs Dixon. ""And the idea of a turf war is ridiculous."" But alongside the crackdown on alcohol, there were other, more serious, things for westerners to worry about. On November 17, Christopher Rodway, 47, from Salisbury, was killed when a bomb exploded in his car. His wife Jane, 50, narrowly escaped. Five days later, a bomb went off under a British car in Riyadh. No one was killed, but six were injured. Within the expat compounds, rumour spread that westerners were being targeted by Islamic fundamentalists. There was an underground movement within Saudi Arabia prepared to use violence in protest at the influx of westerners and what it saw as the un-Islamic excess of the royal family. The rumour, according to Saad Al-Fagih, of the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, in exile in London, carried more than a hint of veracity. ""There are people, you may call them fundamentalists, who believe in using violence who are behind these bombings,"" he said. ""These groups are too small to attack the big targets, like the American army presence, so they have to [go] for something achievable, a soft target. Hitting westerners will make a big fuss. It will intimidate westerners and embarrass the regime. ""Our sources in the interior ministry tell us that Sandy Mitchell has been arrested only to distract attention from what the regime really believes. Fifty fundamentalists have been arrested since Mitchell."" Whatever Dr Al-Fagih's sources, Mr Mitchell's confession remains to con demn him. Yet, on analysis, the confession appears tainted. Looking pallid - and almost two months after his arrest - Mr Mitchell told Saudi television: ""I confirm and confess that I was ordered to carry out an explosion here in Riyadh."" He said he planted a bomb under the driver's seat of the car and Mr Sampson detonated the device by remote control. Neither Mr Mitchell nor the Saudi authorities have revealed who ""ordered"" the explosion. The second bombing Then came his confession to the second bombing. Mr Mitchell said he was talking about the plan for the second attack with Mr Sampson when Mr Schyvens overheard. Bizarrely, Mr Schyvens confessed that he agreed to be recruited into the campaign. But, according to the confessions, Mr Mitchell and Mr Sampson were unsure of Mr Schyvens's commitment. Mr Sampson said he gave Mr Schyvens a dummy device and then telephoned him and told him to plant it on a car owned by a Briton, Steve Coughlan, which was parked outside the Celtic Corner bar. When Mr Schyvens went inside, Mr Sampson said he then planted the real bomb. This scenario does not ring true to survivors of the attack. Mr Coughlan said Mr Schyvens was already inside the bar when he arrived and remained there until they left together, so it would have been impossible for him to take the telephone call. Mr Schyvens was part of Mr Coughlan's drinking group and he left in convoy with Mr Coughlan when the group went to another pub. When the bomb exploded, Mr Schyvens offered assistance. ""It doesn't make any sense to me that if you plant a bomb you sit around in a bar, you leave your car parked next to the bomb, you drive off after the bomb, you help the victims, you give your name to police,"" nurse Jackie Gill, a passenger in the bombed car, told BBC Scotland. So if those who admit to being key players in the illicit Saudi alcohol trade - such as Gary and Mary Dixon - rubbish the idea of a turf war, and the confessions do not ring true to the victims of the crime, why would Mr Mitchell, Mr Sampson and Mr Schyvens make them? Stephen Jakobi, of Fair Trials Abroad, said confession was almost the necessary conclusion of any Saudi interrogation. ""We know that the Saudis use relay interrogation until prisoners will confess to virtually anything,"" he said. ""It is only then that the embassy is allowed to see them, by which point it is too late."" As Mr Mitchell and his co-accused wait in prison, little information is filtering out of Saudi Arabia. If a trial goes ahead, their only hope of escaping execution is the acceptance of a blood money payment by Mr Rodway's family. It would be a convenient scenario, one which would allow everyone to save face. It is almost possible to hear the diplomatic wheels turning.",2001-04-23T01:39:13Z,"{'polarity': -0.037031867843556165, 'subjectivity': 0.4439332096474954}",0.4439332096474954
world/2001/feb/17/iraq.richardnortontaylor,Allied planes bomb Baghdad,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/17/iraq.richardnortontaylor,"US and British planes bombed the outskirts of Baghdad last night in what the Pentagon described as a defensive measure to protect allied patrols over the no-fly zones from increasingly effective Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries. The air strikes, the first against targets in the Baghdad area since Operation Desert Fox in December 1998, had been authorised on Thursday by George Bush, White House officials said, in what appeared to be a signal to Saddam Hussein that the new administration was determined to maintain the policy of Iraqi containment. President Bush, who is visiting Mexico, said: ""A routine mission was conducted to enforce the no-fly zone. Saddam Hussein has got to understand that we expect him to conform to the agreement he signed after he lost the 1991 Gulf war. We will enforce the no-fly zone, south and north. Our intention is to make sure the world is as peaceful as possible."" Lt Gen Gregory Newbold, the US joint chiefs of staff director of operations, said 50 coalition jets from land bases in the Gulf and the aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman were involved in the raid, including 24 strike planes. He said five anti-aircraft ""command-and-control nodes"" were hit. The weapons used were guided missiles fired from planes within the southern no-fly zone. Pentagon officials refused to name the missiles, for fear of tipping Baghdad off as to their effectiveness. The Ministry of Defence in London said that six British Tornados - four bombers and two air defence planes - based in Kuwait took part. The MoD said British and US planes had been threatened by Iraqi air defence systems more times this year than in all of 2000. Iraqi TV said one woman had been killed and 11 other civilians injured in the raid. Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, said: ""This was a proportionate response to a recent increase in the threat to aircraft carrying out legitimate humanitarian patrols in the southern no-fly zone. Saddam Hussein should be clear that we will not tolerate continued attempts to endanger the lives of our aircrew."" Iraqis in Baghdad last night heard explosions at 9.30pm accompanied by the sound of air raid sirens - the first time they had been heard there for two years. Iraqi television interrupted normal programmes to broadcast patriotic songs. The Qatar-based television channel reported that six ex plosions could be heard, followed by anti-aircraft fire. TV footage from a hospital showed five injured - three children a man and a woman. ""Baghdad has come under attack by American aggressors,"" an announcer said. ""This aggression is not new. American planes bomb Iraqi cities daily."" According to Gen Newbold the targets were command-and-control radar installations that coordinate Iraq's air defences. Pentagon officials said it was routine for allied patrols to fire back when they are targeted by Iraqi radar. However, it is unusual for patrols to hit targets outside the southern and northern no-fly zones, originally designated by the United Nations but enforced now only by the US and Britain. Pentagon officials said the planes themselves remained within the southern no-fly zone, south of the 33rd parallel. Gen Newbold said: ""Because Iraqi air defences had been increasing both the frequency and sophistication of their operations, they represented an increased threat to our aircraft and our crews."" The strikes come at a time when support in the west is rapidly eroding for the sanc tions against Iraq, originally imposed when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and maintained in an effort to force the Iraqi leader to give up his attempts to develop weapons of mass destruction. The continued battle of nerves with the Iraqi regime may develop into the first major test of Mr Bush's foreign policy mettle. Observers said the air strike was intended to demonstrate a ""get tough"" approach by his administration. Lawrence Eagleburger, a former US secretary of state, said: ""I'm glad that the Bush administration has made it clear in this one act that they're not going to stand for this nonsense that the previous administration took from Saddam."" Gen Newbold denied that the air strikes were politically inspired, saying: ""The source of recommendations [for the operation] was at the tactical level, which is as it should be."" Russia and China condemned the attacks last night, and the French foreign ministry said they ""gave rise to questions"" and it would be seeking ""explanations"" from the American government.

Lt Neil Tomlin, spokesman for British troops stationed in Kosovo, said that a bus, travelling from the city of Nis in Serbia to the Serb-majority town Podujevo in Kosovo, was attacked shortly after it crossed the boundary into the province. The attack occurred around 11.30am (10.30 GMT) Lt Tomlin said. No other details were immediately available. Kosovo has been the scene of violent attacks by ethnic Albanian militants against the dwindling minority of Serbs ever since the United Nations and a Nato-led peacekeeping force took over after the pullout of the Yugoslav army. Ethnic Albanians are pushing for independence for Kosovo, after suffering repression for some 10 years under the rule of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic. However, this has been rejected by international officials, who are seeking to reestablish a multi-ethnic Kosovo.

world/2001/apr/23/israel1,Car bomb injures two in central Israel,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/23/israel1,"A suspected car bomb has exploded in the central Israeli town of Or Yehuda, slightly injuring two people. Israeli police said that they did not know whether Palestinian militants were responsible. The parked car exploded close to the market area of Or Yehuda, a town south of Tel Aviv. The blast followed yesterday's suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, when a Palestinian blew himself up in a bus queue during the morning rush hour. The bomb also killed an Israeli doctor and sprayed dozens of commuters with shards of metal and glass. Yesterday's attack, which was the second fatal suicide bombing in the central Israeli town in a month, came only hours after security officials from the two sides met for the first time since the latest escalation in the seven-month uprising. On Saturday, Israel admitted that it was holding secret talks with senior Palestinians. Previous bombings inside the borders of the Jewish state have overwhelmed attempts to restart negotiations, leading instead to Israeli reprisals. However, the foreign minister, Shimon Peres, said he hoped to continue the talks that he has been conducting with the speaker of the Palestinian parliament, Ahmed Queria, or Abu Ala as he is usually known.

world/2001/mar/25/jasonburke.theobserver,London link to USS Cole bomb,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/25/jasonburke.theobserver,"American and Yemeni investigators are in London on the trail of the men who bombed the USS Cole, an American destroyer moored in the port of Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, last October. The attack killed 17 US servicemen and wounded 39. It has been blamed on Osama Bin Laden, the alleged master terrorist in hiding in Afghanistan. The team arrived in London two weeks ago seeking suspects based in Britain, Yemeni security sources said. A spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in London confirmed there had been contacts between his country's security officers and British authorities 'in the past'. Last month officers from Scotland Yard's anti-terrorism branch, Special Branch and MI5 arrested 10 Muslim men at addresses in north and west London. Most of the men were Algerian nationals. It is understood the Cole investigators want to interview at least one of them. Western diplomats in Sana'a confirmed that the United States has asked the Yemeni government to postpone the trial of a number of men detained in connection with the bombing to allow new evidence to be gathered in the UK. Yemeni officials said they believed that the British-based suspects were also involved in planning and carrying out the kidnapping of 16 Westerners in 1998. Five British Muslims were tried for their part in the attack, and a preacher at a north London mosque was accused of funding and training them. He has denied any wrong-doing. Yemeni officials said American investigators had recently visited a mountainous region in the southern province of Abyan, which was a stronghold for the group. Leads generated there have brought the team to London. Earlier this month Bin Laden praised the attack on the Cole by two suicide bombers. Washington has accused Bin Laden of masterminding the 1998 attacks on two US embassies in Africa. The Saudi dissident has denied any direct involvement in the attack.

Police identified the victim as Ramon Diaz Garcia, 51, who was married with two children. He was a civilian employed by the navy as a cook. Two other people, aged 16 and 40, were slightly injured in the blast and were being treated at a hospital in the city.

Politicians immediately attributed the explosion to Eta, which claimed responsibility for 23 assassinations in 2000, marking an escalation in its terrorist activity to levels unprecedented since 1992. The attack in the Guipuzcoa province, a stronghold of separatist feeling, is the organisation's first killing this year. Two other car bomb attempts failed in northern Spain earlier this week.

world/2001/jan/22/israel1,Hamas claims Netzarim bomb attack,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/22/israel1,"The Islamic militant group Hamas has claimed responsibility for this morning's roadside bomb attack on an Israeli tank that wounded a soldier near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim in Gaza. The incident occurred as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators tried to hammer out a peace accord in Egypt. They hope to strike a deal before the Israeli elections on 6 February, which could replace the current Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, with hawkish Ariel Sharon. ""The atmosphere is not negative and the discussions on refugees and land, including Jerusalem, are taking place in a very serious and detailed manner,"" said Palestinian information minister Yasser Abed Rabbo. ""If such an atmosphere continues until the end of the week, maybe we will then have a pleasant surprise. This does not mean we have agreed on any of the issues, but the talks are being held in an in-depth and serious way,"" he said. The bomb attack at Netzarim has not hindered the talks so far and did not reverse an Israeli decision to open its borders with the Gaza Strip and the West Bank to the 16,000 Palestinians granted Israeli work permits last month. The attack is the latest incident of violence in 16 weeks of unrest in which at least 368 people have died, most of them Palestinians. Palestinian officials also responded to the change of administration in the US, accusing former US president Bill Clinton of siding with Israel during seven years at the helm of Middle East peace talks and calling on George W Bush's newly inaugurated administration to take a new tack. The Palestinian negotiating team made the comments in a memorandum summing up the Clinton administration's role in brokering talks with Israel since the 1993 Oslo peace accords were signed. The US is the main sponsor of Middle East talks. Palestinian officials close to negotiations with Israel said the letter was intended to notify US President George W Bush of Palestinian dissatisfaction at the way Clinton mediated the peace talks and to urge him ""to avoid making the same errors"". ""Over the last seven years in particular, the US has become increasingly identified with Israeli ideological assumptions,"" they stated in the memorandum. They accused Washington of not taking a tough enough stand against Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the occupied lands that Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war and that Palestinians want for a future state.

world/2001/may/19/israel,War jets attack West Bank after mall bomb carnage,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/19/israel,"Israel unleashed its warplanes against Palestinians in the occupied territories for the first time since 1967 yesterday, pounding two West Bank towns hours after a suicide bombing attack turned a seaside shopping mall into a scene of carnage. In the steepest escalation yet in the eight-month Palestinian uprising, the day delivered two horrifying firsts, sharpening fears that the revolt against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza was edging over the precipice. The day began when an Islamic militant carried out the most lethal suicide bombing inside Israel's borders since the start of the intifada. Israel then bombed the towns of Nablus and Ramallah with F-16 fighter aircraft, killing at least four Palestinians in the harshest such reprisal so far. The Israeli response came hours after the hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon, met with his security cabinet to decide on a response to the Netanya bombing, which killed five Israelis, and a separate drive-by shooting in the West Bank which killed a Jewish settler. Fresh pleas for restraint from Washington went unheard. ""Our country is deeply concerned,"" the US president, George Bush, told reporters in Washington. ""We must break the cycle of violence in order to begin meaningful discussion about any kind of political settlement."" The attack marks the first use of Israeli fighter jets against Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza since Israel captured those territories in the 1967 war. As night fell on the West Bank town of Nablus, Palestinian rescue workers scrambled to pull limbs and body parts from the rubble of what had once been a security headquarters. At least three people were killed in the bombing - including inmates in an adjacent prison - and more than a dozen injured. A fourth Palestinian was killed when the fighter jets bombed a post of Yasser Arafat's Force-17 security detail in Ramallah. Israel also launched missile attacks on the Gaza Strip. Israeli leaders said it could be an augury of further such attacks by F-16s. ""We won't say in advance what means we'll use, but it's surely not the last time that we'll use warplanes,"" a junior cabinet minister, Danny Naveh, told Israeli television. ""The Palestinians are going to pay a very dear price. We lived a very difficult day today and our anger is great."" Several people in the throng funnelling past the security guard into the shopping mall at Netanya at about 11.30 yesterday morning noticed something unusual about the clean-shaven, neatly groomed young man in the long, navy jacket loitering near the entrance. ""He was just standing there, waiting for the crowd to collect,"" said Eli Seroussi, 26, whose body was pierced by the nails that tore out of the device. ""He looked up to the sky, he paused for a moment, and then, boom."" Since the start of the uprising last autumn, many Israelis have avoided public places, fearing they are potential targets for bombers, and guards at shopping malls routinely inspect the boots of cars for bombs, and scan handbags with metal detectors. Despite such vigilance - and several warning calls received by police - the patrol car arrived after the bomber struck. The Netanya police chief, Avraham Biran, said even the tightest security cordon could not stop a determined suicide bomber. ""If a man wants to explode himself, it does not matter whether you come early or not,"" he said. The explosion was the seventh of 10 threatened attacks by the Islamic militant group, Hamas. In a statement, the organisation's armed wing identified the bomber as Mahmoud Ahmed Marmash, a 21-year-old carpenter from the West Bank town of Tulkarem. His family described him as devout, but said he had no history of political involvement. The Hamas claim appears to have determined Israel's choice of targets in Nablus. Palestinian officials said the war planes were aiming to destroy the prison where Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, a mastermind of several Hamas bombings, was held. Abu Hanoud, was injured and taken away to safety, his brother Mustafa said. The attack on Netanya was the deadliest in a spate of suicide bombings. Yesterday, as on other occasions, an ugly crowd assembled at the scene of the attack, chanting: ""Death to Arabs"". But an even bigger tragedy was averted because a security guard barred the bomber's entrance to the shopping mall after receiving a warning over his walkie-talkie, channelling the bomb outwards towards the street. Officials from Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority were swift to condemn the attack, saying they deplored the targeting of civilians. But, judging from the drastic escalation last night, such disavowals are unlikely to have much impact on Mr Sharon, who is under pressure from even more rightwing members of his government to exact harsh reprisals.

world/2001/feb/22/spain,Two dead in Basque bomb blast,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/22/spain,"A car bomb exploded in the northern Basque coastal city of San Sebastian this morning, killing two men and injuring at least four others, authorities said. The authorities suspect that Basque separatist group ETA is behind the killings. The blast occurred at 8am local time (7am GMT) in the Martutene neighbourhood, about 200 meters from a commuter train stop, an Interior Ministry spokesman in the Basque region said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Ambulances rushed victims to the Aranzazu hospital, which said two men had died. They were identified as Jose Angel Santos Larranaga and Josu Leones Azkona, workers for Electra, an electricity company. Four other men were being treated for injuries at the hospital. One of the injured was identified as Ignacio Dubrueil Churruca, a councillor from the Socialist party in the nearby Basque town of Ordizia, party member Rosa Diez said. Mr Dubrueil was only slightly injured, she said. ETA has frequently used car bombs as part of its 32-year-old campaign for Basque independence in which some 800 people have been killed. The group has been blamed for one killing so far this year, also in San Sebastian. If today's killings are linked to ETA, they would bring the number of victims to 26 since the armed separatists ended a 14 month cease fire in December 1999. Today's explosion followed the announcement two days ago that the Basque government would hold early elections in the region in May. It occurred exactly one year after another car bomb killed Fernando Buesa, a leading member of the Socialist party in the Basque region, and his police bodyguard.

world/2001/feb/10/saudiarabia,Saudi security scare raises bomb doubts,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/10/saudiarabia,"Prince Nayef, the Saudi minister who is heading investigations into bomb attacks against Britons, has doubled the number of his personal bodyguards to 300 men, opposition sources said yesterday. Although a Briton, a Belgian and a Canadian have confessed on Saudi television to two of the bombings, and nine other foreigners are under arrest, the prince's move casts doubt on whether they are the real culprits, Saad Fagih of the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia said yesterday. All 12 suspects, as well as the victims of two car bombs in Riyadh on November 17 and 22 last year, have been linked to illicit drinking activities in the Saudi capital. But the authorities have offered no explanation for three subsequent bombs. On December 5, a Scotsman, David Brown, lost an eye when a juice carton placed near his car's windscreen exploded in the eastern town of al-Khobar. On January 10, a small explosion occurred in a telephone kiosk outside the Euromarche shopping mall in Riyadh. Four days later, police defused a bomb found under an Irishman's car in Riyadh. Almost all the western suspects were under arrest when the two most recent incidents occurred. Prince Nayef, the interior minister, has always taken his safety seriously, but the doubling of his bodyguard followed the discovery of a note at the scene of the Euromarche bombing, Dr Fagih said. He added that two different sources had told him that the bombers' note had warned that there would be another, much larger, explosion if Prince Nayef did not release their ""brothers"". Besides the 12 foreigners, the authorities are holding about 70 ""mojahedin youths"" in connection with the bombings. Meanwhile Gary Dixon, the Briton who ran the Empire drinking club in Riyadh, was yesterday trying to launch a last-minute appeal against his deportation from Dubai to Saudi Arabia on alcohol-related charges. A friend said: ""He's afraid they may try to make him out as 'Mr Big' in the bombings.""",2001-02-10T01:20:04Z,"{'polarity': -0.03201754385964912, 'subjectivity': 0.28728070175438597}",0.28728070175438597
world/2001/mar/05/israel,Suicide bomb is new blow to peace,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/05/israel,"A Palestinian wearing a backpack containing explosives blew himself up in this Israeli coastal town yesterday, killing three passers-by and injuring more than 60 others in an attack that could signal a vicious upswing in the five-month uprising. The suicide mission was the first inside Israel since the start of the uprising, and the third bombing within the borders of the Jewish state in five days. Both facts underlined Israel's vulnerability to attacks by dedicated Palestinian militants despite its overwhelming military might, and its siege of the West Bank and Gaza. Israelis began their working week yesterday struggling with the images of horror visited on a seaside town north of Tel Aviv during the morning rush hour. Minutes after the attack, onlookers rounded on an Arab man, and beat him unconscious. He was taken to hospital in critical condition. Even with the resort to such drastic measures as the construction of an 11-mile trench around the town of Jericho, yesterday's bombing makes it clear that no Israeli can ever feel completely safe while the uprising continues. ""There is no such thing as 100% security,"" Israel's police chief, Shlomo Aharonisky, said. Other police officers warned of more suicide missions in the coastal heartland a day after the armed wing of the militant group, Hamas, warned that it had signed up 10 bombers willing to die to launch attacks inside Israel. The Hamas threat deepens the sense of crisis and dread awaiting the hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon, whose government could be sworn in as early as Wednesday. Mr Sharon has vowed to hold no negotiations with the Palestinians until such attacks end. At the same time, he is facing mounting pressure to live up to his reputation as a warrior and exact harsh reprisals against the Palestinian Authority of Yasser Arafat. On Saturday, Israel's army chief, Shaul Mofaz, said Israel was ""obliged to raise the threshold in our amount of action and our pressure on the terrorists, and those who send them"". Yesterday, Rehavam Ze'evi, a far-right minister in the incoming cabinet, called for Israel to re-occupy tranches of the West Bank under Palestinian rule. The president, Moshe Katzav, warned that now Israel would be forced to take harsher measures. Mr Sharon appeared to be heeding their demands. He told reporters in Tel Aviv yesterday: ""The government which I hope will be formed in a very short time will be able to find appropriate answers that will return security to the citizens of Israel"". He seconded the accusations from Gen Mofaz, and from the chief of Israeli intelligence yesterday, that the ""most trusted forces"" in Mr Arafat's administration participated directly in the recent bombings. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, and Hamas claimed no knowledge of the bombing. All but one of the earlier bombings inside Israel during the last five months have been linked to the rival Islamic Jihad militant group, or to previously unknown organisations. However, Hamas did claim a January 1 bombing on the same road in Netanya, which injured 40 people. Amid the rhetoric on both sides, the stage appears set for a new escalation in the uprising to mark the installation of Mr Sharon's government, and the Jewish festival of Purim later this week, which has often been marred by violence. Police said yesterday's bomb was a relatively small device, but they believe the Palestinian militant had been in the Netanya area for several days, waiting for his moment. It was not immediately clear whether he was part of the cell behind two bombings last week, in Tel Aviv and in northern Galilee. Yesterday's suicide bomber struck just before 9am with lethal effect, killing two women and a man. ""I saw hands and legs all over the street. It looked like a butcher's shop,"" said Israel Aaron, a traffic policeman. Mr Aaron said he held out little hope that Mr Sharon could end the violence with strong-arm tactics. ""We tried strong, but I do not think it is a good solution. We kill some Palestinians, and then they kill some of us. We score a goal, and then they score a goal, and it goes on and on. It is like ping-pong. We have to stop it, and sit down and talk."" •A Palestinian man suspected of collaborating with the Israeli intelligence services was stabbed to death in a village near the West Bank town of Jenin, Israel Radio reported yesterday.

world/2001/feb/23/spain.gilestremlett,Eta bomb kills two as election starts,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/23/spain.gilestremlett,"A car bomb blamed on the Basque separatist group Eta exploded outside a busy railway station in the coastal city of San Sebastian yesterday, killing two people and seriously injuring four others. Doctors said that the suspected target, Inaki Dubreuil, a Socialist councillor from the nearby town of Ordizi, escaped with relatively minor injuries and was being treated for burns and shrapnel wounds. His bodyguard was also hurt when the 6kg (13lb) bomb was detonated at 8am. The bomb killed two workers from a nearby electronics factory: 31-year-old Josu Leonet and José Angel Santos, 40, both said to be supporters of Herri Batasuna, Eta's political wing. The bomb followed the announcement on Tuesday that early regional elections will be held in May. Herri Batasuna could lose at least four of its 14 seats in the 75-seat assembly. The election is expected to be fought over how to end Eta's 32-year campaign of violence for Basque independence. The regional premier, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, of the Basque Nationalist party, wants to hold talks with Eta but his attempts to work with Herri Batasuna, especially during the 14-month unilateral ceasefire that Eta called off in December 1999, have failed to produce anything resembling a peace process. His efforts have made him the target of fierce attacks from Spanish prime minister José Maria Aznar's centre-right Popular party, which accuses him of encouraging terrorism. ""This [bomb] shows that there is no point in trying to talk to Eta, as some nationalists think,"" said the regional Popular party leader, Carlos Iturgaiz, after the bomb. Mr Aznar yesterday met his interior minister, Jaime Mayor Oreja, to discuss the minister's plans to leave the cabinet and lead the Popular party in the Basque polls. Mr Oreja, himself a Basque, will be hard to replace. The tough-minded minister refused to talk with Eta during its ceasefire and is a popular cabinet member. The Popular party, which has lost 11 councillors to Eta's gunmen in the past six years, is expected to gain the most ground in the May elections, although opinion polls show that it is unlikely to overtake Mr Ibarretxe's Basque nationalists which have won every regional poll since democracy was restored 25 years ago. Mr Aznar hopes Mr Oreja will win enough votes to form a coalition government with the Socialists, making it the Basque region's first non-nationalist government. • A suspected high-level Eta commander was arrested yesterday in Anglet, France, about 40 miles from San Sebastian, after being spotted in a bar.

The blast caused panic and brought back memories of the bomb in a city centre underpass which killed 12 people and maimed scores last summer, and of a string of explosions the previous summer which killed 300 people in various parts of Russia. Last night's bomb at the Belorusskaya (White Russian) station exploded in a passage between two underground lines. The police said that about 200g of TNT was left in a shop ping bag on a bench in the passage. The state television channel RTR, which broadly speaks for the Kremlin, said: ""In all likelihood this was a terrorist act."" Fire engines, ambulances and teams of police and secret service agents rushed to the scene after the explosion occurred, just before 7pm.

world/2001/mar/16/saudiarabia,Briton feared hurt after bomb in Saudi capital,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/16/saudiarabia,"Two men, one of them believed to be a Briton, were injured in an explosion outside a bookshop in the centre of the Saudi capital, Riyadh, last night, raising fears of a concerted bombing campaign targeting foreign workers in the Gulf kingdom. Saudi police said one victim was a 47-year-old Scotsman; the Foreign Office agreed it was possible he was British. Earlier reports had suggested the injured European came from the Netherlands. The other victim was described as either Egyptian or Sudanese; neither was seriously hurt. The two men were taken to the private al-Hammadi hospital but later released. The blast, caused by a device hidden in a bin outside the al- Jareer bookshop, was the fourth involving overseas workers in Saudi Arabia since November. The explosion smashed windows but did not cause widespread damage. The building also houses the newspaper al-Hayat. Struc tural damage was minor. Saudi security forces briefly sealed off the area of the blast, diverting traffic to side streets. Two bombings in Riyadh between November 17 and December 15 killed a Briton and injured four others. A third blast, in Khobar in eastern Saudi Arabia, injured one person. Abdullah al-Shahrani, the city's police chief, last night said his officers were investigating the latest bombing but did not immediately link it to the other explosions. Shortly before Christmas, three foreigners working in Saudi Arabia - a Briton, a Belgian and a Canadian - were arrested. They remain in custody. The three appeared on Saudi state television last month and confessed to carrying out the bombings. Alexander Mitchell, chief anaesthetics technician at a hospital in Riyadh admitted planting the car-bomb which killed another Briton, Christopher Rodway. Five other Britons are being held for alleged alcohol offences. If convicted, Mr Mitchell could face the death sentence. The latest bombing may cast fresh doubts on official Saudi claims that the bombings are the work of foreigners. Saudi newspapers have linked the Riyadh bombings to turf wars between westerners fighting over the profits of multi-mil lion pound illicit drinking clubs. Selling or trading in alcohol is banned in the conservative muslim kingdom. Amnesty International urged Prince Charles to raise the issue of whether the detained men can expect a fair trial when he visited Saudi Arabia last month. ""We hope he will use his influence and raise with his Saudi hosts issues such as torture and unfair and secretive trials, particularly in the light of the current detention of a British national,"" an Amnesty spokesman said. Last month the Foreign Office said it was worried about the situation of the detained Britons but insisted: ""Through our ambassador Britain is taking every opportunity to raise these cases at the highest level."" The Saudi interior minister, Prince Nayef bin Abdel Aziz, has revealed that another Briton with links to Mitchell, Gary Dixon, 55, had been arrested in the United Arab Emirates. Dixon fled to Dubai after being arrested last April on suspicion of illegal manufacturing and distribution of alcohol. Prince Nayef said he expected that Mr Dixon would be handed to the Saudi authorities soon.

world/2001/mar/05/thailand,"Bomb was meant for me, says Thai prime minister",World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/05/thailand,"The new prime minister of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra, said yesterday that an explosion on Saturday on a Thai Airways jet at Bangkok's Don Muang airport minutes before he was due to board it was probably an assassination attempt and an inside job. Mr Sinawatra was in a nearby VIP lounge when the explosion occurred in the front section of the Boeing 737-400 near where he was scheduled to sit. One member of the cabin crew was killed. The prime minister's life was thought to have been saved by a half-hour departure delay. ""It is clear now that it [the explosion] was not caused by the engine, but involved explosives,"" he said in the northern city of Chiang Mai, where he eventually arrived by military plane. ""This is an attempt to hurt somebody. I don't know whether I was the target or somebody else but, as far as I know, there were no other important people on the flight."" Mr Shinawatra refused to speculate about who might have been responsible for the blast, but one of his security advisers, Police General Prasarn Wongwai, said the billionaire telecoms tycoon had his suspicions. ""I have already talked to the prime minister and he seems to have a clue who did it. But he wouldn't want to talk too much because it might pressure the investigation officials."" Thailand's air investigation agency, which is leading the investigation, has yet to comment officially on what caused the explosion. But, as the engines were not switched on at the time of the explosion, a mechanical malfunction is expected to be ruled out. Thailand is no stranger to coup attempts, but no prime minister in this constitutional monarchy has faced an assassination attempt. Last night Mr Shinawatra suggested that someone close to him must have been involved in the explosion; he had originally planned to go to Chiang Mai yesterday but told his secretary on Friday to change the flight to Saturday afternoon. ""If I was a target of the explosion, the one who placed the bomb should have had access to my schedule,"" he said. Local media are speculating that the most likely perpetrator is someone with links to the extremely lucrative drugs trade in the Golden Triangle, the region where Thailand, Burma and Laos meet. Mr Shinawatra made repeated promises during the election campaign to crack down hard on drug traffickers, particularly drug lords in Burma moving their wares through Thailand. He reiterated that promise yesterday, vowing to eradicate the ""rampant"" drugs trade that is blighting the region. The manifest showed that 149 passengers, including the prime minister and his son, were booked to be on flight TG114 to Chiang Mai. Mr Shinawatra's Thai Rak Thai (Thai Love Thai) party swept to power largely on the back of the leader's personal popularity, bolstered by campaign promises of tens of thousands of pounds for every village, and tax cuts. Despite his party's landslide victory the prime minister might be out of office in a couple of months if a corruption indictment against him is upheld by the constitutional court. He is accused of hiding assets while serving in a previous administration. His defence could include the fact thatthat Thais knew of the scandal well before polling day but still voted for him in record numbers.",2001-03-05T03:01:14Z,"{'polarity': 0.07646168315811173, 'subjectivity': 0.4362025870954443}",0.4362025870954443
world/2001/mar/13/iraq.usa1,Bomb mishap,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/13/iraq.usa1,"Yesterday's bombing accident in Kuwait is the latest in what appears to be a worsening series of US military mishaps which the new Bush administration has said are a legacy of declining readiness and morale left over from the Clinton years. Over the course of last year's presidential campaign, George Bush portrayed the armed forces as being at the end of their tether, underpaid, overstretched and no longer able to fight two wars simultaneously - the Pentagon's benchmark of military strength. However, a closer examination of recent accidents show no clear pattern. It was too early yesterday to judge whether the Navy F-18 Hornet which dropped a 500lb bomb on a group of military observers did so because of pilot error or a malfunction. A military inquiry was immediately launched. The accident is unlikely to be the result of a lack of experience. Operation Southern Watch, in which US and British planes patrol the no-fly zones over southern Iraq, has been going on for almost a decade. The al-Udairi range in northern Kuwait has been in use for almost as long. The last major military accident, involving a collision in February between a US submarine, the USS Greeneville, and a Japanese fisheries training vessel, the Ehime Maru, in which nine people were killed, is still the subject of an inquiry. It seems likely that the presence of 16 civilians on board played a role in the miscalculations of the crew, who were performing a rapid surfacing manoeuvre for the benefit of their visitors. The presence of civilians on military operations like the Greeneville's is arguably a result of a squeeze on military funds, in which each armed service must compete for popular support. But arguably, that has always been true. The US navy may have simply gone too far on this occasion. The other major accidents in recent years have involved the ill-fated and expensive MV-22 Osprey which, in a string of crashes, has cost the lives of more than 30 servicemen. A government report published last week suggested that those crashes were a result of over-eagerness on the part of the different armed services to commission the helicopter-plane hybrid before it was fully tested, in order to secure a $40 billion share of the Pentagon budget for new projects. In fact, far from being overstretched, some critics of the Pentagon believe it has become too complacent and set in its cold war ways to adjust to the requirements of a century in which the principal dangers are terrorists and ""brush-fire"" wars in which US soldiers have been called on to keep the peace. Writing in the Los Angeles Times last week, Lawrence Korb, a senior Pentagon official in the Reagan years, argued that peacekeeping was not overstretching the US military. In fact, he said, such operations only took up 2% of the military budget. ""The military does not need to be rebuilt; it needs to be transformed,"" Mr Korb wrote. ""In the 1990s, the Pentagon invested more than a trillion dollars in developing and procuring new weapons. But much of it was wasted on cold war relics - $200m fighter planes, $6bn aircraft carriers, $2bn submarines, $400m artillery pieces-that will be of little use in the conflicts of the 21st century."" A history of tragic military blunders February 9 2001 A US navy submarine sank a Japanese fisheries training vessel by colliding with it, killing people on board. The USS Greeneville, a 109-metre attack submarine based at Pearl Harbour, which was carrying 16 civilians, hit the Japanese ship as it surfaced.

world/2001/apr/14/chechnya.russia,Moscow's No 2 in Chechnya killed by bomb in TV studio,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/14/chechnya.russia,"The fragile pro-Kremlin administration in Chechnya suffered a new blow yesterday with the assassination of its deputy leader in a bomb attack on a local television studio. Adam Deniyev was fatally injured when a bomb exploded in the studio where he was broadcasting a live reading from the Koran on Thursday evening. He died later from head injuries. The attack took place in his home town of Avtury, in a region of Chechnya south-east of Grozny ostensibly under Russian control - demonstrating again the weakness of Russia's grip on the region. Mr Deniyev is the most powerful pro-Moscow official in Chechnya to have been assassinated during the course of the war. Chechen rebels claim to have compiled a death list containing all the names of officials in Chechnya appointed by the Russian government. Any Chechen who agrees to work for the Russian-imposed local government is viewed as a traitor by separatist fighters and is vulnerable to attack. Several have already been killed. The murdered administrator was appointed by the Kremlin to help restore stability to the separatist republic, shattered by two devastating wars over the past decade. Akhmad Kadyrov, his direct superior and head of the pro-Moscow administration, immediately blamed the Chechen rebel leader Aslan Maskhadov for the killing. Mr Kadyrov, who has survived several assassination attempts, claimed that both he and Mr Deniyev had received threats from Mr Maskhadov. ""This is another act of terrorism. They have killed somebody who was trying by every means possible to restore normal life to Chechnya,"" he said. This attempt to cast the dead official as a blameless agent for the future good of Chechnya was dismissed by Chechen experts in Moscow. Mr Deniyev had himself been accused of murder and was widely believed to be collaborating with the Russian security forces, the FSB. He was named as a suspect in a 1999 US state department report in the murder of six Red Cross nurses. The nurses were discovered shot dead in their beds in Chechnya in 1996. At the time, Russian officials blamed the killings on Chechen rebels, but the murders remained unsolved. Andrei Babitsky, the Radio Liberty reporter who disappeared for a month last year after Russian troops handed him over to Chechen rebels in a bizarre prisoner exchange, said after his release that he had not ended up in rebel hands but been imprisoned in Mr Deniyev's house. The journalist, whose critical coverage of the conflict in Chechnya infuriated the Kremlin, said he was held by pro-Moscow Chechens under Mr Deniyev's orders until international pressure apparently prompted the Russian government to order his release. Mr Maskhadov swiftly denied responsibility for the killing yesterday. ""The Chechen leadership offers its condolences to the FSB, which has lost an important collaborator in Deniyev,"" a spokesman said.",2001-04-14T00:20:10Z,"{'polarity': 0.026223776223776224, 'subjectivity': 0.3178515928515929}",0.3178515928515929
world/2001/jun/21/worlddispatch.michaelellison,Hispanic vote helps ban the bombs,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/21/worlddispatch.michaelellison,"It's not quite the same as a triumphant tour of Europe, as if George Bush knew anything about that. But the president looks as though he has effected a diplomatic victory in a borderline foreign land by giving the people of a Caribbean island what was theirs for the taking. CNN transmitted the news the other day that protests against the US navy practice bombing on Vieques - eight miles east of Puerto Rico - were now in the hands of the hardcore. What this meant was that hardly anyone was there. Jackie Jackson, wife of Jesse, was the best that the anti-navy movement could offer this time in the way of a sacrificial trespasser. No Jesse. No Robert Kennedy Jr. No Rev Al Sharpton (the professional troublemaker is serving a harsh 90 days for his incursion during the last round of exercises). Certainly, there was no sign of Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony, Jose Feliciano or Benicio del Toro. The entertainers were among those who had already paid the price of protest: in their case, more than $100,000 (£71,600) for a full-page advertisement in the New York Times. There was to have been a November referendum on Vieques, population 9,400, asking whether the islanders wanted the Navy to carry on bombing as it has done for 60 years, or to have it leave by the spring of 2003. Mr Bush, the nation's first Hispanic president in much the same manner as Bill Clinton was the first black in the White House, decided that the vote would not happen. Instead, the navy would leave by, yes, spring of 2003. This was always going to happen anyway: the people who voted seven months ago to elect a mayor who has been arrested twice for trespassing on navy land were not going to decide this year to allow the military to stay. Mr Bush seems to have knocked the stuffing out of the protest, even if the 150,000 who protested in the Puerto Rican capital of San Juan last year seem not to have noticed that the bombing will continue until the navy does go. Perhaps Vieques will fade back in the mainstream American mind to the position it occupied until two years ago when a stray bomb killed a Puerto Rican security guard: that is to say, no position at all. But then the American mind is not quite what it was, or seemed to be, particularly since the latest census confirmed the evidence of everyone's eyes. There are a lot of Hispanic people about - more than 14% of the US population - at least as many of them as there are black people, and they have votes. There are 3.8m Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico, 2.8m in the US and 1.2m in New York City. Michael Bloomberg, the born-again Republican running for New York mayor, is learning Spanish. George Pataki, the governor of the state, lets slip no opportunity for a Paz Para Vieques. He would like to be re-elected. Hillary Clinton, a senator representing New York, lives la vida loco too, though, to be fair, she was doing so before the census reported its findings. The navy and Republican defence hawks are not happy. They say that this island, two thirds of its 33,000 acres occupied by the armed forces, is the only place where they can practice air, sea and land assaults at the same time. Too bad. St Kitts and Nevis is considering whether it might like to offer itself as an alternative. It is not always mentioned that the navy has used only dummy bombs since the security guard was killed. Certainly, no one ever asks if a movement such as this could crystallise anywhere else in the world over one terrible death. But Puerto Rico has a strange relationship with the US: it is a commonwealth whose people are US citizens but cannot vote for president while they are in Puerto Rico and are represented in Congress by an observer. Against that, they pay no federal income tax. Several surveys claim that the navy's actions have damaged the health of the islanders - not least that the cancer rate is 27% above that of the Puerto Rican mainland - but agreement among the experts is infuriatingly elusive. Agreement on anything is elusive. A piece in the New Statesman last month simpered that ""the Independistas"", an engine in the protest, ""are a proud and fierce lot."" They may be many things, but a ""lot"" is not one of them. The Puerto Rican Independence party has never approached double figures in polls. Puerto Ricans vote for the status quo every time they are asked. Time magazine tried to suggest that there might have been a darker motive behind the announcement that the navy would go: money. This notion involved a firm that intends to open a resort on the island later this year donating money to the Republican party. The resorts company, it was revealed, is half-owned by the half-brother of a Bush ally in Texas. In fact, the resort was also supposed to open last year and was delayed by a dispute between the company and the builders. Vieques has a drug and Aids problem and a rather heavy police force. The average income is $6,400; in Mississippi, the lowest in the US, it is $20,993. You could blame the navy, and you could also ask what the government of Puerto Rico has been doing about it all these years.

""There's been some harm done in the past. These are our friends and neighbours and they don't want us there."" But it will be nearly two years before the 9,400 residents of Vieques are left alone. Meanwhile, bombing is due to begin again on Monday. Mr Bush is said to favour ending the military exercises because he fears losing the support of Hispanic voters. But he seems to have missed the point. ""We don't want the bombing stopped in 2003, we want it stopped now,"" said Robert Rabin, a spokesman for the Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques. ""The demands of the community are immediate and permanent - cessation of all military activity, the removal of all military artefacts and equipment, and the decontamination and return of all lands to the people of Vieques."" Congressman Jose Serrano, from New York, said: ""If they continue the bombing and say they're leaving in 2003, then that's unacceptable, because the people in Puerto Rico and on Vieques and those of us in the 50 states who are involved in this issue, want the bombing to stop immediately."" In many respects the announcement is academic. The navy has already agreed to leave by May 2003, if that is what the islanders vote for in a referendum in November. And that is what people who have elected a mayor arrested twice for trespassing on the bombing range are sure to do. The navy has occupied two-thirds of the Caribbean island for the past 60 years. It calls the range ""the irreplaceable crown jewel of our training"", because it is possible to combine air, land and sea exercises there. More than 180 protesters, including the New York activist the Rev Al Sharpton, the actor Edward James Olmos, and the environmental lawyer Robert F Kennedy Jr, were arrested during the last exercises in April. Mr Sharpton is serving 90 days in jail and has been on hunger strike for two weeks to draw attention to Vieques. The latest round of opposition to the navy started two years ago when stray munitions killed a Puerto Rican security guard. The protesters set up camp on the range and defied the navy to carry on bombing. They were removed a year ago, and training was resumed with dummy munitions. The islanders say they have a cancer rate 27% higher than the Puerto Rican average, suffer from noise damage, and have a higher than average incidence of heart problems.",2001-06-15T00:38:34Z,"{'polarity': 0.04190909090909092, 'subjectivity': 0.34558585858585866}",0.34558585858585866

world/2001/may/10/israel1,Romanian workers killed in Gaza bombing,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/10/israel1,"Two Romanian workers were killed and one was wounded in a powerful roadside bomb explosion on the Gaza Strip today, one day after two Jewish teenagers were found stoned to death in a West Bank cave. This morning's explosion occurred at the border between Gaza and Israel, south of the Kissufim crossing, as the three men were working on the border fence. One worker was killed immediately, while another was seriously injured and died later. In recent years Israel has increasingly employed workers from eastern Europe and the far east, to replace Palestinians who are often unable to reach their jobs in Israel because of security closures. In an apparent response to the explosion, Israeli bulldozers razed Palestinian farmland and a police station near Kissufim, in the fifth incursion into Palestinian territory in two days. Overnight, Israeli troops destroyed four homes and a Palestinian police station in the Rafah refugee camp. 12 Palestinians were hurt. The bodies of the Jewish boys who were stoned to death, 14-year-old Kobi Mandell - a US citizen - and Yossi Ishran, 14, were found in a cave about half a mile from their homes in the Jewish settlement of Tekoa, south-east of Bethlehem. The boys' heads were so badly disfigured that facial identification was impossible, police said. Seven months of violence in the Middle East have claimed the lives of dozens of Palestinian children and at least six Israelis under the age of 18. The high-profile killings this week provoked a new round of recriminations. Mr Sharon said he was revolted by the killings of the Israeli teenagers. ""It was a heinous deed in which children were intentionally attacked,"" he said. Asked whether Mr Arafat was still a potential negotiating partner, Mr Sharon said: ""Anyone who causes the killing of Israeli citizens cannot be a partner"". If violence stopped, Israel would be ready to resume peace talks, he added. Meanwhile Israel army radio has reported that the Israeli government has slashed its five-year funding plan for Jewish settlements from 1.5bn shekels (£264m) to 600m shekels (£106m), in response to US pressure. The Israeli cabinet secretary, Gideon Saar, today said that the Israeli government has not yet decided how much money to allocate, but it would do everything necessary to improve security in the settlements.

world/2001/mar/25/chechnya.ameliagentleman,Chechen rebels blamed for bombings,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/25/chechnya.ameliagentleman,"The Kremlin blamed Chechen rebels yesterday for three near-simultaneous bomb attacks in the South of Russia which left 21 dead and more than 130 wounded. The most devastating car bomb exploded near a crowded outdoor market in Mineralnye Vody - the capital of the Stavropol region, which borders the separatist republic of Chechnya - at around 10am, killing 12 passers-by instantly. The blast destroyed several cars parked near the market entrance, sprayed the busy area with lumps of charred metal and shattered windows in surrounding streets. Badly wounded residents, injured as they went shopping, lay bleeding on the pavement. Hospital staff were struggling to cope with the numbers of casualties. More than 20 were last night said to be in a critical condition. Officials said the bomb had been detonated by remote control and contained bolts and screws to cause extra injuries. A second bomb ripped through a car in the nearby smaller town of Yessentuki, about 18 miles south of the regional capital, at almost the same time; around 16 people were injured. Two Interior Ministry policemen were killed in a third car bomb explosion as they searched a suspect car by the road in the neighbouring Karachayevo-Cherkessia region. One suspect was arrested. Police in Stavropol said they believed the three blasts had been coordinated. In each incident a Zhiguli - a Russian-make estate car - had been loaded with explosives and was detonated at around 10am, officials said. The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, said: 'Once again blood has been shed and once again peaceful civilians have become the victims of cruel terrorist attacks. The most rigorous possible measures will be taken to ensure that the perpetrators of these ignoble killings are found and punished in the shortest possible period of time.' A high-level crisis team - including Russia's chief pros ecutor, Vladimir Ustinov, and the head of the Russian Federal Security Service (the FSB), Nikolai Patrushev - was dispatched to the region by Putin yesterday morning to start investigating the cause of the blasts. But even before the inquiry had been opened several senior Kremlin officials were already publicly blaming Chechen rebels for the attacks. Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky claimed the attacks bore 'the hallmarks' of a Chechen operation. 'As a rule, Saturday is chosen, cars are driven to places crowded with people and parked near the entrance to a market, and then detonated,' he said. But Mairbek Vachagayev, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov's representative in Moscow, said the President had categorically denied any Chechen involvement. Vacha-gayev added that Chechens had become a scapegoat, regularly blamed by the government for all blasts that occurred anywhere in Russia. 'That way they don't need to search for anyone,' he said. Last week a court in southern Russia sentenced two men to life imprisonment for an apartment block blast in the Dagestan town of Buinaksk. The court was told that they had been promised $30,000 (£21,000) to complete the job by a Chechen rebel warlord.",2001-03-25T03:54:47Z,"{'polarity': -0.012857142857142855, 'subjectivity': 0.3467216117216117}",0.3467216117216117
world/2001/apr/28/usa.michaelellison,Islanders fail to stop US bombs,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/28/usa.michaelellison,"The United States navy resumed its controversial bombing practice on a small Puerto Rican island yesterday, ignoring protesters and a new law against noise pollution passed by the territory's government to try to curtail the bombing. About 200 demonstrators gathered outside the entrance to the shelling range on Vieques, 52 square miles of beaches and green hills off the east coast of Puerto Rico. The navy owns two-thirds of the island, and uses a 900-acre piece at the eastern end as a range for bombing by ships and jets. While the bombs and shells used are dummies, the protesters believe that the loud noise is harming residents' health. A security guard was killed by stray shells in 1999. In the past two days 14 people have been arrested and accused of trespass after breaching security to enter the range. A court ruling in Washington on Thursday cleared the way for the exercises to resume, though the judge noted that the navy had implied to residents that it would hold off bombing until studies were finished into claims that the noise caused heart troubles. 'This is a sad day for Vieques,' said Nelson Lopez Aponte, a priest on the island. But, he said, 'If the Berlin Wall fell, so can the navy ... The rule of God is peace. You can never get peace by bombing.' Protesters say that the navy has damaged the health of the island's 9,300 people - the cancer rate is 27% above that on the Puerto Rican mainland - depleted fish life, stunted tourism and diminished the islanders' self-respect. The US claims that the range is essential. 'Vieques is a superb training range, the best in the entire Atlantic for the uses that the navy and marines put it toward,' said Rear Admiral Craig Quigley. Vieques has been taken up as a cause by celebrity dissidents such as Jesse Jackson and Robert Kennedy Jr. The governor of New York, George Pataki - who has millions of Hispanic voters - was on the island recently to show sympathy. Benicio del Toro, an Oscar-winning Puerto Rican actor, is among the protesters. Puerto Rico's new anti-navy governor, Sila Calderon, also persuaded 11 stars - boxers, baseball players, and singers Ricky Martin and Marc Anthony - to take out full-page ads in prominent US newspapers asking President Bush to stop the bombing. 'It's really the first time that Puerto Rico is standing up to the US,' said Dario Moreno, a political scientist at Florida International University. Puerto Rico exists under the US umbrella as a commonwealth: its people are US citizens who so far have shied away from asking either for independence, or to become a US state (meaning they would have to pay federal taxes). As non-taxpayers they cannot vote in presidential elections, but are largely self-governing. The governor has been accused of breaking a deal her predecessor made with the Clinton presidency, under which the island will vote in November on whether the Navy should stay or go by 2003. The result is not in doubt. Puerto Rico's legislature has denounced the agreement as offering too little, too slowly and some Republicans in Congress are trying to block part of it, the return on May 1 of 8,000 acres to the island and $40m in aid. The Vieques government is broke, unemployment rampant, education poor and health care minimal.",2001-04-28T01:16:22Z,"{'polarity': 0.06675436632333184, 'subjectivity': 0.460363487087625}",0.460363487087625
world/2001/may/29/september11.usa,Men convicted over US embassy bombings,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/29/september11.usa,"A jury in New York has convicted four men of conspiracy to murder for the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in east Africa that killed 224 people. The convicted men are members of an Islamic militant group led by Saudi-born dissident, Osama bin Laden, who has been indicted in the US as the mastermind behind the bombings. The verdict marks the first US conviction of anyone charged with crimes stemming from bin Laden's activities. Two of the men, Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali, 24, of Saudi Arabia, and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, of Tanzania, could face the death penalty when a sentencing hearing begins tomorrow. The other two men, Wadih El-Hage, 40, a naturalised US citizen born in Lebanon, and Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, 36, of Jordan, were found guilty of conspiring to kill American citizens. The jury of seven women and five men deliberated for twelve days before reaching their verdict. They had heard nearly three months of testimony about the twin blasts at the embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Some appeared stunned as they viewed photos of the torn and burned bodies, charred cars and smouldering concrete ruins that followed the attacks. The bombs went off almost simultaneously on August 7, 1998, killing 201 Kenyans, 12 Americans and 11 Africans of other nationalities. The jury also heard prosecutors repeatedly invoke the name of bin Laden. They charged that as the kingpin of the al-Qaeda terrorist organisation, he commanded a ragtag army of Islamic extremists who had answered the call to repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. As early as 1989, prosecutors said, bin Laden was taking aim at another superpower - the United States - and by 1998 had issued an edict to kill Americans anywhere they were found. A key government witness, former terrorist Jamal al-Fadl, testified that bin Laden referred to the United States as the ""head of the snake."" The bombings brought an unprecedented worldwide response to terrorism by hundreds of FBI agents and prosecutors. Treating terrorism like organised crime, investigators used informants, turncoat terrorists, telephone bugs and confessions to build the case. More trials are expected. Of 22 people indicted in the bombing, six are in custody. The others are still being sought. Bin Laden is one of the America's most wanted criminals. He is believed to be in Afghanistan and the US government is offering a $5m (£3.5m) reward for information leading to his arrest.",2001-05-29T15:31:12Z,"{'polarity': 0.036124401913875594, 'subjectivity': 0.40725677830940993}",0.40725677830940993
world/2001/feb/07/saudiarabia,Briton accused of Saudi car bomb 'sold drinking den' to victim,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/07/saudiarabia,"Alexander Mitchell, the Briton facing execution in Saudi Arabia after he admitted planting a car bomb, had a business relationship with the man he is accused of killing, sources in Riyadh's expatriate community said yesterday. Mr Mitchell, 44, was shown on Saudi television confessing - along with a Belgian and a Canadian - to having bombed two cars in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, last November, killing one Briton and injuring five other people. A total of nine people - none of them Saudis - are being held by the authorities in connection with the investigation. All were members of, or shareholders in, a series of illicit drinking dens in Riyadh - Celtic Corner, Woodlands, Raffles and the Empire Club. Mr Mitchell, a former soldier, worked as chief anaesthetics technician at the Security Forces Hospital in Riyadh but also had a stake in three drinking dens for expatriates and supplied satellite dishes - officially banned in the kingdom - as a sideline. He later sold his stake in one of the drinking dens to Christopher Rodway, the 47-year-old Briton who died in an explosion on November 17. Letters regarding the transaction were written by Mr Mitchell on a hospital computer which has been seized by the Saudi authorities, the sources said. Oddly, Mr Mitchell also developed a serious interest in religion, friends said yesterday. He read many books on Islam and, on the night of his arrest last December, had been due to attend a party at the hospital where he and several colleagues were to announce their conversion to the faith. In the televised confessions, Mr Mitchell and his co-accused said they had been ordered to carry out the bomb attacks. Yesterday the Saudi-owned newspaper, Asharq al-Awsat, quoted the interior minister, Prince Nayef, as saying that ""foreign countries were behind the orders"" and had ""provided them with high-tech explosive materials"". He said the countries were ""linked to the nationalities of those arrested"". A military plastic explosive called C4 was used in the attacks, he said. C4 was developed for the US military during the Vietnam war. It has been sold by the US to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran (under the shah), and several Nato countries possess it. The US also used it in the 1991 Gulf war. The formula for C4 is not secret and quantities have occasionally been stolen. About 20 years ago a former CIA agent was convicted of shipping 21 tons of C4 to Libya, allegedly for terrorist training. More recently it was used by terrorists in the bomb attack on the USS Cole in Yemen last October which killed 17 people and injured 39. Shortly after the killing of Mr Rodway the Saudi authorities began hinting that the attack was not terrorist-related. Their investigation centred on his acquaintances and in particular on any grudges they may have held against him. The Saudi authorities have now agreed to let British con sular staff visit Mr Mitchell, the Foreign Office said yesterday. The agreement came during an hour-long meeting between the British ambassador and the Saudi interior minister. ""The ambassador requested repeated consular access to Mr Mitchell and the interior minister undertook to grant that request,"" a spokesman said. Under Saudi law, Mr Mitchell will only be allowed to see a lawyer once the investigation into his case has been completed. Lawyer Stephen Jakobi, of Fair Trials Abroad, said the confessions were ""show trials"" and added: ""I would say this is the worst case affecting a European citizen I have seen anywhere in the world."" Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, said the Foreign Office should be firm in its demands that the Britons were properly treated. But he added: ""If there's been a breach of the law in Saudi Arabia then the Saudi Arabian authorities are entitled to prosecute."" Mr Rodway's father, Jerry, 69, a retired sales representative from Salisbury, Wiltshire, said that if Mr Mitchell was found guilty of killing his son he should be executed.",2001-02-07T02:43:53Z,"{'polarity': -0.039837398373983736, 'subjectivity': 0.2884146341463414}",0.2884146341463414
world/2001/mar/02/israel,Bomb blast rocks Galilee,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/02/israel,"A taxi van that had unwittingly carried a Palestinian bomber and his lethal cargo of explosives across a swath of Israel blew up at a road block in Galilee yesterday, killing one person and injuring nine. Israeli television said the taxi had been boarded by at least one Palestinian bomber near Tel Aviv, and that its other passengers - who were Jews as well as Arabs - had no idea they were riding alongside a 2kg bomb. It was not immediately clear whether the dead man was one of the bombers. Police said they had been hunting a Palestinian militant cell for 24 hours, after sappers defused an explosive device planted on a busy street in central Tel Aviv. The bomb, like yesterday's, was designed to be detonated by a mobile phone. The bomber is believed to have detonated yesterday's bomb after the taxi was pulled over at a roadblock near the Arab town of Umm al-Fahim in northern Galilee. The force of the blast blew the roof off the white taxi van and shattered the windscreens of passing vehicles. It also sheared the legs off one suspected militant, who police said was a Palestinian man from the town of Jenin, in the West Bank. He had confessed to plotting Wednesday's thwarted attack, police said, which was claimed by the previously unknown group, called the ""Return Brigades"". ""I heard a loud explosion .. I saw body parts, someone's hand,"" David Grosser, a lorry driver at the scene, said. ""Everyone was in shock. I cried myself for half an hour. Today it's me, tomorrow it's you."" No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but as in past attacks inside the borders of the Jewish state during this five-month Palestinian uprising, Israeli officials accused Yasser Arafat of indirect responsibility. The outgoing deputy defence minister, Efraim Sneh, said Mr Arafat's Palestinian Authority had failed to rein in Islamic Jihad militants, who have claimed some of the bombings during the past five months, or Hamas. ""As long as activists of Hamas and the Jihad are walking around free in the West Bank and Gaza, the responsibility is on those who let them walk around freely,"" Mr Sneh said. ""We see the Palestinian Authority as responsible for the situation."" Yesterday's attack comes as Israel's hardline prime minister-elect, Ariel Sharon, enters the final stages of assembling a national unity government which is expected to act even more harshly against the Palestinian uprising. In recent days, Mr Sharon's advisers have called for an acceleration of the assassination of Palestinian leaders, and for deepening the siege on the West Bank and Gaza. Their demands grew even more strident yesterday. ""We can not talk English here, this is the Middle East,"" said Meir Sheetrit, a senior leader of Mr Sharon's Likud party, yesterday. ""Here we have to talk Arabic."" On Wednesday, Israel's army chief, Shaul Mofaz, said the military would even consider reoccupying the areas of the West Bank and Gaza now under Palestinian rule. Gen Mofaz's statements to visiting Jewish leaders met an angry response from Palestinian security officials yesterday. ""He should know that the worst kind of terrorism and violence is the occupation,"" said Jibril Rajoub, the leader of the Palestinian security apparatus in the West Bank.",2001-03-02T01:57:39Z,"{'polarity': -0.022474747474747474, 'subjectivity': 0.4295454545454545}",0.4295454545454545
world/2001/feb/05/saudiarabia,Briton admits to bombings in Riyadh,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/05/saudiarabia,"A British man has confessed on Saudi Arabian TV to bombings which killed another Briton and injured several others. Alexander Mitchell told the Saudi Arabian news that he and two others, a Canadian named as William Sampson and an unnamed Belgian, had followed orders and exploded two bombs in the capital, Riyadh, last year. The first, on November 17, killed 47-year-old Christopher Rodway, from Gloucestershire, and injured his wife, Jane, 50. The second, five days later, injured three Britons and an Irish woman working for the Al-Salam aircraft company, owned by Boeing. The news bulletin broadcast pictures of Mitchell and what it claimed was an Arabic translation of his confession. An Arabic voice-over said: ""I confirm and confess that I received orders to carry out the bombing here in Riyadh on November 17 against Christopher Rodway, a British citizen. William Sampson, a Canadian, helped me carry out the bombing."" He did not say who ordered the attacks but the other two men also spoke of their involvement.

world/2001/jan/25/jonathanwatts,Japan 'bombed city with plague',World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/25/jonathanwatts,"A Tokyo court heard yesterday that the Japanese army dumped fleas infected with bubonic plague on a Chinese city in 1940, in a deadly trial of germ warfare. The claim was made by a Chinese scientist in a case against the Japanese government brought by 180 relatives of those who were killed in experiments carried out by the imperial army's notorious Unit 731 during the second world war. Huang Ketai, a bacteriologist, said at least 109 people were killed in an outbreak of plague in Ningbo, south of Shanghai, in November and December 1940. Just a few days before the onset of the disease, several people saw Japanese planes drop fleas and grain over houses in the city, leading him to conclude that the population was being used as a guinea pig for a deadly pathogen. ""It is very clear that the outbreak was caused deliberately,"" he said in response to questions from the three judges hear the case, which is nearing the end after more than four years. ""The timing and geographical spread of the disease all point to the conclusion that its origin was the cargo dumped by the planes."" Ningbo was no stranger to the plague, which at the time struck north-east China every few years. But Dr Huang, the first scientist to give evidence in the case, said there were several differences in the 1940 outbreak: it came in winter rather than summer, killed humans but few rats, and was carried by a flea that was not native to the region. It was also unusual in the the rapid rate at which the outbreak spread, the number of lives it claimed and its short duration. ""This was a particularly virulent form of the plague that could only have been created artificially by Unit 731,"" he told the court. According to the plaintiffs' case, Unit 731 killed at least 2,100 - mostly Chinese - people in an attempt to develop a biological weapon that could win the war for Japan. Witnesses have said that the effects of the unit's germ warfare experiments are still being felt in China, because the germ bombs released pathogens which continue to return. As well as the psychological fear of a fresh outbreak of disease, people in north-east China have to bear the cost of razing properties suspected of being infected. For years after the war, the activities of Unit 731 remained veiled in secrecy. According to academics, its actions were barely covered in the proceedings of the Tokyo war crimes tribunal because the United States wanted to use the results on live subjects. Recently, after a series of confessions by veterans, the Japanese government acknowledged the unit's existence. But it still refuses to reveal the scope of the scientists' activities. Government lawyers maintained this policy of silence in the courtroom yesterday, not challenging, not challenge a single word of the claims made by Dr Huang and two other Chinese academics. ""I suspect they will seek to have the case overturned on a legal technicality rather than try to dispute the facts,"" the plaintiffs' lawyer, Tsuchiya Kohken, said. ""That's because the facts are indisputable."" The verdict is expected in early summer.",2001-01-25T02:44:28Z,"{'polarity': -0.01698567305710162, 'subjectivity': 0.2667687074829932}",0.2667687074829932
world/2001/jan/29/zimbabwe.andrewmeldrum,Bombs wreck Harare presses,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/29/zimbabwe.andrewmeldrum,"A series of huge explosions destroyed the printing presses of the Daily News in Harare early yesterday. They followed a week-long campaign against the newspaper by President Robert Mugabe's government. Residents throughout Harare heard the explosions at about 1.30am. They tore the roof off the large factory and mangled the printing presses. Much Masunda, chief executive of Associated Newspapers of Zimbabwe, which owns the Daily News, said several men distracted security guards at the plant's front gate while others knocked down part of the back wall and broke in. Five big bombs were placed at key points among the presses and then detonated. Forensic experts say the perpetrators had considerable knowledge of explosives. Extensive damage was caused to the presses, valued at £1.2m, and it is unclear when the Daily News will be able to print again. ""This is a grave setback, but it will not deter us,"" Mr Masunda said, surveying the wreckage. ""This is a result of a general breakdown of law and order in this country. We will not be silenced. We will come back even stronger."" The Daily News was launched nearly two years ago and has been strongly critical of Mr Mugabe's government, including Zimbabwe's involvement in the Congo war and numerous corruption scandals. Its circulation soared above 100,000 a day, outstripping the state-owned Herald which has become a virulent mouthpiece of the government. The Daily News offices were bombed in April last year. A couple of months later a man confessed that the state central Intelligence organisation (CIO) had hired him to kill its editor, Geoff Nyarota. Daily News reporters have been beaten by war veterans who support Mr Mugabe. Last week war veterans besieged the newspaper's offices twice and smashed its windows, while police stood by. Throughout the country war veterans he country seized and burned copies of the Daily News. ""The Mugabe government mounted this campaign against the Daily News because it counters the lies and propaganda of the state media on a daily basis,"" said Trevor Ncube, the editor and publisher of the Zimbabwe Independent, a weekly business paper. ""I blame Jonathan Moyo [the information minister] and Robert Mugabe for using language which incites such violence. ""It was obvious it would culminate in something like this. ""Mugabe is leading this country towards a state of civil war. The government has lost the battle for the hearts and minds of the people. ""All that it has is intimidation and violence.

world/2001/feb/20/iraq.comment,Comment: Paul Foot on the Baghdad bombing,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/20/iraq.comment,"When is a war criminal to be bombed, and when is he to be subsidised? One answer comes this week as a result of the peculiar genius of President Bush and his lapdog in Downing Street. Just as a war criminal, still soaked in the blood of Palestinians whose murders he engineered and authorised in Sabra and Shatila refugee camps nearly 20 years ago, gets elected as prime minister of Israel, so Bush turns the international spotlight on Saddam Hussein and subjects still more Iraqi civilians to another round of ""routine"" aggression. Saddam, we are reminded, became a war criminal for the gassing of Kurds when US policy in the Middle East was based on unconditional support for him. Such grotesque contradictions pollute all US policy in the Middle East. When Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1990, a vast array of military force was deployed under the banner of the United Nations to put a stop to such a blatant breach of international law. When Israeli forces invaded the West Bank, the Golan heights and East Jerusalem in 1967, seizing, occupying and exploiting whole tracts of other peoples' territory by force of arms; when the Israeli government refused to give up an acre of that territory as UN resolutions recommended it should; and when this blatant breach of international law was followed up with an equally illegal invasion of Lebanon in 1982, the reaction from the US was to step up aid to Israel, which gets far more money from the US government than any other country in the world. The guiding moral principle of US policy in the Middle East is that war criminals from Israel should be subsidised by the US taxpayer while Arab war criminals should be punished only if and when they threaten the supply of cheap oil to the US. A farcical glimpse of these contradictions came last week from the man who skilfully failed to secure peace in the Middle East: Bill Clinton. Clinton was on television angrily rebutting charges of corruption arising from his last-minute presidential pardon for the appropriately named Marc Rich, a ""financier"" who has been hiding in Switzerland for 17 years to escape federal charges of tax fraud in the US. Bursting with indignation on the Geraldo Rivera chat show, Clinton made it absolutely clear that the pardon for Rich had nothing whatever to do with the fact that the fugitive's former wife Denise gave a million dollars to the Democratic party; nothing whatever to do with Mrs Rich's handsome donation to Hillary Clinton's campaign to become a New York senator; and absolutely nothing to do with the $450,000 Mrs Rich gave to the Clinton presidential library. None of these things influenced him one jot, said Honest Bill. ""Now I'll tell you what did influence me,"" he added. ""Israel influenced me profoundly."" His attitude to Mr Rich, so resolute in defiance of all those contributions to his party and his library, had been profoundly moved by a letter from Shabtai Shavit, the former head of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. Mr Shavit described the fugitive financier as ""a fine and generous individual"" who had ""used his extensive network of contacts"" all over the world to ""produce results"" for Mossad. What more persuasive argument could an ex-president with his back to the wall have deployed to sway US public opinion behind him? His party, his wife and his library may have been heavily subsidised by the Rich family, but his real motive in securing a pardon for Mr Rich was to spring to the aid of Mossad and Israel. Anti-Arab, pro-Israel prejudice in the US is as powerful as ever, but in Britain, I would say, it is on the wane. This is thanks at least partly to strong and indignant journalism, including the commentaries from David Hirst and the recent reports from the occupied territories by the Guardian's Suzanne Goldenberg. Robert Fisk of the Independent has been gloriously and contemptuously furious at the bombings. But the journalist who has probably done more than any other to bring into our front rooms the suffering of the Iraqi people from western sanctions is John Pilger. Brushing off the ludicrous charge that he is soft on the dictator Hussein, Pilger has identified the real victims of sanctions - the helpless Iraqi civilians whose sickness and suffering flow directly from the economic sanctions which have left the dictator even more powerful than he was 10 years ago. A new book about Pilger's television reporting published next week by Bloomsbury has come under savage attack from his old adversary, William Shawcross. So furious was Shawcross that even before he read the book, he rang Bloomsbury to protest about it. ""I think Bloomsbury are making a terrible mistake,"" he tells the Daily Telegraph. Mr Shawcross helped to found the anti-censorship organisation Article 19 in 1988 with a moving commendation. ""Freedom of speech is indivisible,"" he revealed. Yet this is not the first time he has personally intervened to influence a publication. A long article in the Observer in March 1997 asked whether a former Czech dissident Jan Kavan was an agent for the hated Czech secret police StB under the former Stalinist regime. The article stated: ""Among his contacts Kavan knew a British citizen - Mr X - who the StB had identified to their own satisfaction as a British intelligence officer."" In the original article, Mr X was named as Shawcross. Whether or not the Czechs were right - they were often wrong - that he had links with British intelligence (and certainly Mr X emerges from the article with considerable credit) Shawcross moved heaven and earth to have his name held out. In his latest diatribe in the Telegraph, Shawcross denounces John Pilger's television programmes as ""rubbish"". This seems rather harsh since as far as I know John Pilger has not published (as Shawcross has) long, profound, boring and flattering studies of those two specialists in rubbish, the former Shah of Iran and Rupert Murdoch.",2001-02-20T03:02:58Z,"{'polarity': 0.03267045454545456, 'subjectivity': 0.46954711954711953}",0.46954711954711953
world/2001/mar/26/worlddispatch.india,Pakistan revels in nuclear power,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/26/worlddispatch.india,"For all those worried about nuclear rivalry between India and Pakistan, it was not exactly a reassuring sight. Trundling down Islamabad's main boulevard on Friday, as part of a massive parade to mark national day, were two of Pakistan's latest nuclear-capable missiles. Thousands of ordinary Pakistanis had climbed trees, or pushed towards stick-wielding policemen to watch. As the Shaheen I and Shaheen II ballistic missiles moved into view, the crowd burst into wild applause. ""Atom bomb! Atom bomb!"" was the chant. ""Atom bomb! Atom bomb!"" The missiles continued their stately journey to the far end of the boulevard, past Pakistan's defunct white marble parliament, to the podium where Pakistan's military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, was waiting. He saluted crisply. ""The Shaheen can hit India in six minutes,"" one of the ordinary Pakistanis in the crowd told me. ""It is anti-Bharat [India]. We can also hit Israel with it."" The fact that the giant green-and-brown missile shown off three days ago was probably only a huge dummy was of little consolation. As my new companion explained: ""The real thing is on the border with India. Can hit more targets that way."" Pakistan's annual national day parade held every year is not exactly a new spectacle. It commemorates a 1940 resolution that led to the creation of Pakistan seven years later as a homeland for the subcontinent's Muslims. It was not just Pakistan's short and intermediate range missiles that were on display: Puma helicopters, Russian-made T-80 tanks, and F16 bombers also took part, as well as assorted cultural troupes and military bands. However, the ceremony has been given new piquancy by the fact that the army is once again in charge in Pakistan, following a coup 18 months ago, and by the country's new nuclear status. Pakistan declared itself a nuclear power in May 1998, following tit-for-tat tests between with India. It is now the world's seventh nuclear power, and the first Islamic country to have - as the jubilant crowds put it - ""atom bomb, atom bomb"". Peace talks, meanwhile, between India and Pakistan have foundered. The sticking point, as always, is Kashmir, a subject that provokes passionate reactions from ordinary Pakistanis, but arouses little interest - verging on boredom - from ordinary Indians. ""It is all your fault. You British people should sort it out,"" one man in the crowd told me. Fifty years on it was a bit late for that, I replied. As if to reinforce his point, the boulevard was decorated with yellow banners that declared: ""Kashmiris too have a right to live."" Nevertheless, the prospect of a meaningful dialogue over Kashmir in the near future is, to put it mildly, remote. Kashmir has an overwhelming Muslim majority, which is Pakistan's main grievance. India refuses to discuss Kashmir until, it says, Pakistan puts an end to ""cross-border terrorism"". By cross-border terrorism, India means the procession of often fanatical young men who move illegally into Kashmir, having received military training at religious camps in Pakistan. They then attack Indian army posts in the name of jihad. Pakistan, by way of response, says India has no interest in bringing about peace in the region. As Pakistan's president, Mohammad Rafiq Tarar, put it on Friday: ""We have taken several positive steps to create a congenial atmosphere, including a partial pullback of troops from the Line of Control [the de facto border between India and Pakistan]  But it is a matter of great regret that a positive response to our efforts is not forthcoming."" Somewhere in this the views of ordinary Kashmiris get lost. Many, undoubtedly, favour cession with Pakistan. But others merely want the restoration of normality that the valley used to enjoy - and the withdrawal of Indian security forces. The Kashmir problem - longstanding, complex, and intractable - is not going to go away. Nor are the nuclear weapons, paraded through downtown Islamabad three days ago. What happens next in one of the trickiest sagas brought about by colonialism is a matter of uncertainty, to most people at least. Except, perhaps, to the faithful, that is. ""When Pakistani troops go into battle they are assured of victory,"" one man told me. Why is that, I asked? ""Because they have the support of Allah,"" he replied serenely. • When it comes to VIP culture, Pakistan can match India in every respect. Sitting on a restaurant terrace in the hills high above Islamabad, enjoying the sunset and a cup of iced coffee, I was approached by a Pakistani police officer. ""You'll have to leave,"" he said. The reason, it transpired, was that Senegal's president, Abdoulaye Wade, had decided to drop in too, with a few friends. In honour of his official visit, army officers closed off not only the restaurant but also the hills themselves. President Wade had a quick look at Islamabad's geometric skyline, before heading inside for a cold, non-alcoholic drink.

world/2001/feb/23/iraq.michaelellison,Most western bombs missed Iraqi targets,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/23/iraq.michaelellison,"Fewer than half the missiles fired by Britain and the United States at radar installations around Baghdad a week ago hit their targets, the Pentagon disclosed yesterday. It indicated that computer software used in the missiles' guidance system was being considered as one possible cause for the failure rate, with bombs landing up to 50 metres from the sites. ""We have detectable damage on 38% to 40% of the radars and we still have some data coming in,"" said a Pentagon official who rated the results as mediocre at best. The details emerged as US planes struck in northern Iraq for the first time since last week's attack, which was the biggest in more than two years. The US European Command said that yesterday's assault was in retaliation against Iraqi artillery which fired at western aircraft patrolling the northern zone where Britain and the US have prohibited Iraqi aircraft from operating. A Pentagon spokesman had said earlier that last week's attack on five radar and communications installations - which Iraq now says killed three people and injured 25 - had achieved its objective of disrupting and degrading Iraq's air defences but would say little more for fear of helping Baghdad to prepare for any further bombing. The 24 British and American planes were deployed because of intelligence that Iraq was integrating its air defences with fibre-optic links that would give it more chance of bringing down enemy aircraft. The US says the work is being done by the Chinese. Baghdad denies this. ""We have some concerns about the performance in about half the weapons because of what appears to be a consistent offset from the aim point,"" an American defence official said of last week's attack on on the radar centres. ""It implies a common cause whether environmental like wind, whether software or guidance, because it is consistent."" Only eight strikes on about 22 radar units had been confirmed; eight others showed no apparent damage. There was not enough information to be sure about six more. He bypassed some of the embarrassment over the missed radar units by saying that there was greater success against the nodes that link these units to command centres controlling the anti-aircraft system in southern Iraq. ""The way to disrupt the integrated air defence system is to go after computer vans, the electronics that link these things,"" he said. ""The radar is less important. I don't think we've taken the possibility of further strikes off the table at all."" Colin Powell, the US secretary of state ,who is visiting the Middle East this weekend, has two main options for dealing with Iraq: sanctions and military action. ""Containment [of the regime] has been a successful policy and I think we should make sure that we continue it until such time as Saddam Hussein comes into compliance with the agreements he made"" at the end of the Gulf war, he said. But the secretary of state said six years ago in his autobiography: ""Sanctions work best against leaders who have the interests of their country and their people at heart."" He put the Iraqi leader in a different category, of those consumed by their own interests.

world/2001/feb/17/balkans,Seven die as Serb convoy is bombed in Kosovo,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/17/balkans,"Seven Serbs died and 43 were injured yesterday when an explosion tore through the first of five coaches carrying families from the Serbian city of Nis to Gracanica in Kosovo. The convoy, carrying about 250 people and escorted by five Swedish armoured personnel carriers and a medical detachment, was attacked yesterday morning near Podujevo, 25 miles north-east of Pristina. The families - Kosovo Serbs who had left the province fearing ethnic Albanian attack - had planned to visit the graves of relatives in the Serb enclave of Gracanica today, the Orthodox Day of the Dead, and to celebrate mass there. Brigadier Robert Fry, a senior British member of the peacekeeping force, called the explosion ""a ruthless pre-meditated attack of mass murder"". It was the second most deadly attack motivated by ethnic hatreds since mid-1999, when large-scale violence ended with the pullout of Yugoslav troops from the province. Swedish first aid teams helped the injured at the scene and the most serious cases were evacuated by helicopter to a US army hospital. The condition of 10 of the injured was said to be severe. British troops investigating the bomb said it contained 68kg (150lb) of explosive. It had been hidden in a culvert under the road and detonated by wire. Clothes and children's books could be seen among the shards of metal and glass scattered over the road. Gorica Stjepanovic, 24, who survived the attack with eye injuries, said that two Nato armoured personnel carriers had already driven over the bomb. ""All of a sudden, everything burst, the bus seemed to have fallen apart,"" she said. ""Blood was dripping from the roof, we were trying to see whose blood. Somebody's leg was hanging from the window. When I managed to get out, parts of bodies were everywhere. The hardest thing was to see a child, three to four years old; it wasn't breathing, and no one could help."" Her fellow survivor, Sasa Stojanovic, 28, said: ""I saw people flying through the glass, but they seemed to be more body parts than people,"" he said. Brig Fry confirmed that a patrol heading into the area to check for such devices had been distracted just before the bomb went off. ""I had a patrol coming in the opposite direction at that time, whose very purpose was to check culverts and to try and ensure the security of the route,"" he said. ""Just as they approached the seat of the explosion their attention was caught by two men on a nearby hillside. They stopped, went to catch the men, apprehended them, and were walking them back to their vehicles when the explosion occurred."" Two ethnic Albanians found near the scene have been detained but it was not clear if they were involved. Violent protests erupted in Serb communities across Kosovo as news of the attack spread. The main road south of Pristina was blocked and two lorries set alight. In Gracanica, crowds attacked and burned a UN vehicle. A Kosovo Serb leader, Oliver Ivanovic, announced a Serb rally today in Mitrovice, the ethnically divided town that has been the focus of repeated Serb-Albanian violence. In Belgrade, the Yugoslav parliament cut short a session in protest and politicians condemned the attack, which comes just two days after a Serb man was killed and two children were injured when a gunman attacked their bus near Strpce in the south of Kosovo. The violence also appears strikingly similar to incidents a year ago, when a convoy of UNHCR buses was attacked with a rocket-propelled grenade, killing two. That was followed by the murder of seven Albanians in Mitrovice. The Nato secretary general, George Robertson, called the killings a ""disgraceful and cowardly incident"". ""Nato did not conduct its air campaign [the strikes against Yugoslavia in 1999] in order to see ethnic cleansing by one group replaced by the ethnic attacks and intimidation of another,"" he said.",2001-02-17T02:09:48Z,"{'polarity': 0.0020202020202020154, 'subjectivity': 0.3691919191919193}",0.3691919191919193
world/2001/mar/13/iraq.usa,Six dead as US plane bombs wrong target,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/13/iraq.usa,"Six people were killed and 10 wounded yesterday when a US Navy plane missed its target in a training exercise in Kuwait and dropped a bomb on parked cars near the Iraqi border, according to Pentagon officials. At least four of the dead were Americans and one was a New Zealander. There were also five Americans and two Kuwaitis among the injured as a result of the the accident during a joint US-British-Kuwaiti exercise at the Udairi bombing range, about 30 miles from the desert border with Iraq. The plane, a Navy F-18 ""Hornet"" was operating from the USS Harry Truman aircraft carrier patrolling the Gulf. Early reports suggested that the pilot may have mistaken a group of parked vehicles for a target when it dropped a 500lb bomb on a group of military observers. According to Kuwaiti officials, the vehicles had their lights on and were intended to guide the planes involved in a ""close air support"" exercise to wards their targets. US defence officials said it was too early yesterday to give the reasons for the accident. Lieutenant Colonel Joe Lamarca, a spokesman for the US Central Command, said the accident occurred at around 4pm GMT. ""There were 16 confirmed casualties, which include dead and injured,"" he said, adding that the casualties were taken to a Kuwait military hospital. Col Lamarca added that Kuwaiti, British and New Zealand forces were playing a support role in the exercise. An MoD spokesman later confirmed that there were no British casualties. British soldiers had not been involved in that specific exercise and were nowhere near the area at the time of the accident, he said. The accident comes at a time when the US Navy is struggling to recover from another lethal mishap, the deaths of nine Japanese, caused by a US submarine colliding with their fishing boat off the coast of Hawaii on February 9 during an emergency surfacing exercise. The latest accident happened shortly after the 10th anniversary of the Gulf War and at a time when Arab sympathy for the plight of Iraq is at a height and when the US military presence in the region is increasingly unpopular. President George Bush, speaking in Florida where he was promoting his tax proposals, called on an audience of supporters to hold a moment of silence for the dead, saying the accident was a reminder of ""how dangerous service can be"".",2001-03-13T02:22:46Z,"{'polarity': 0.006397306397306397, 'subjectivity': 0.33644781144781144}",0.33644781144781144
world/2001/jan/04/michaelellison,Embassy bombings trial begins in US,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/04/michaelellison,"Four men appeared in court yesterday in a trial which the prosecution wants to turn into an in absentia case against the fugitive Saudi Arabian millionaire Osama bin Laden, more than two years after the bombings of two US embassies in which 224 people died. The four, charged with conspiring with Mr Bin Laden to bomb the embassies, were led into the federal court in Manhattan wearing white Islamic clothing. The location is resonant with meaning: it is the court in which six men were found guilty of bombing the World Trade Centre in 1993. Concrete and metal barriers were in place outside the courthouse, but with only six cameras present the media circus was more of a sideshow. Families of victims of the bombs in Nairobi, Kenya, and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in August 1998 were there to take the gloss off the attempt inside to unfold an image of a global international terror plot. Edith Bartley, whose father and brother died in the Nairobi attack, said: ""They [the US government] were playing Russian roulette with Americans lives and they continuing to do so. ""The government was negligent. Our American government chose not to look at warnings. ""The position of Madeleine Albright and our government is one of arrogance."" Stuart Newberger, a lawyer representing most of the 12 Americans killed, said: ""All the families of the victims of this gross act of terrorism have been anxiously awaiting what the US government can accomplish in processing justice against these people."" The prosecutors expect to call 100 witnesses from six countries and to use confessions, computer and telephone records, and other evidence. The trial is expected to take at least nine months. Jury selection alone, from a pool of 1,500 people, is likely to stretch beyond three weeks, during which the public and press are excluded. One man has already pleaded guilty to conspiring with Osama bin Laden and is expected to be the star witness for the prosecution, acting as a window on the world of the west's most reliable bogeyman. Ali Mohamed's evidence linking Mr bin Laden to the bombings is the bridge on which the prosecution hopes to extend the trial into an examination of an organisation accused of killing westerners all over the world. ""We will pursue this goal for however long it takes and wherever in the world the evidence leads us,"" said Barry Mawn, assistant director of the FBI's New York office. Ali Mohamed, 48, a former US army sergeant who has not been sentenced yet, told an earlier hearing that Mr bin Laden asked him seven years ago to carry out surveillance on British, American, French and Israeli targets in Nairobi. ""I took pictures, drew diagrams and wrote a report,"" he said. Mr Mohamed's plea-bargain terms have not yet been made public. ""Bin Laden looked at the picture of the American embassy and pointed to where a truck could go as a suicide bomber. The objective of all this was just to attack any western target in the Middle East, to force the governments of western countries just to pull out of the Middle East, not to interfere."" In all, 22 people have been charged with the bombing: the four who went on trial yesterday, who have all denied the charges; another who will face the New York court later; three awaiting extradition from Britain; and 13, including Osama bin Laden, who remain at large. Two of those on trial are liable to the death penalty if they are found guilty. They Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 23, a Saudi national accused of being a would-be suicide bomber in the Nairobi explosion; and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, an Tanzanian, who is charged with helping to carry out the attack in Dar es Salaam. Wadih el Hage, 40, a Lebanese-born US citizen, is charged with serving as a leading aide to Mr bin Laden. The prosecutors say that the fourth defendant, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, 35, a Jordanian, has already admitted that he was a member of al-Qaeda, Mr bin Laden's organisation.",2001-01-04T02:09:32Z,"{'polarity': 0.002435064935064937, 'subjectivity': 0.28252164502164506}",0.28252164502164506
world/2001/may/03/michaelellison1,"Klansman who bombed church gets life sentence, 38 years on",World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/03/michaelellison1,"A former member of the Ku Klux Klan was in jail for life yesterday for the murder almost 38 years ago of four black girls who died when their church in Birmingham, Alabama, was bombed - an event which became a turning point in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Thomas Blanton, 62, intends to appeal on the grounds that he could not get a fair trial in Birmingham and that he was not tried by his peers: there were no white men on the jury which took 150 minutes to convict him. ""I guess the good Lord will settle on judgment day,"" Blanton said on Tuesday before he was led from the court in Birmingham, a city where the Klan once used so much dynamite that it was known as Bombingham. He was one of four men named in an FBI report soon after the explosion at the 16th Street Baptist church in 1963 killed a girl of 11 and three others aged 14. No case was brought at the time. Subsequently, one of the four died in jail and a second without going to trial. Blanton and Bob Frank Cherry were indicted by a grand jury last year, but Mr Cherry's trail was postponed on the grounds of mental incapacity. Yesterday the Rev Abraham Woods, a black minister who helped to persuade the FBI to reopen the case, said: ""Now it's time to go after Cherry. I am tired of hearing about his mental competency. They have tried mentally retarded black men."" The strongest evidence against Blanton was on secret FBI tapes of his conversations after the bombings. The FBI director J Edgar Hoover resisted attempts by his Birmingham office to take the four to court, trial despite pressure from Presidents John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson. Hoover feared what would happen if witnesses felt too intimidated to testify, and he believed that no jury would convict them. Craig Dahle, an FBI special agent in Birmingham, said yesterday: ""Reviews of the files showed to us that back in the 60s the case was worked actively and Hoover never blocked the case. He was worried about getting a conviction."" 'I like to go bombing' The tapes do not capture Blanton saying that he bombed the church, but he did boast to a friend: ""I like to go shooting, I like to go fishing, I like to go bombing."" In another recording he spoke to his wife about a Klan meeting ""when we planned the bomb"". His wife asked: ""Tommy, what meeting are you talking about."" He replied: ""We had that meeting to make the bomb."" He also talked about bombings in general to a friend who had turned FBI informer. ""They ain't gonna catch me when I bomb my next church,"" he said. The prosecution told the jury of eight whites and four blacks that these were the words of the 16th Street bomber; the defence claimed that they were the ravings of a racist redneck braggart. Doug Jones, the US attorney who prosecuted, said it was ""not an overwhelming case."" Witnesses had died over the years, and one who had intended to testify was unable to do so because of having a stroke. Richard Arrington, who was the city's first black mayor, said afterwards: ""It's a very positive development. It was one of the most heinous crimes in this country. There have always been those who have said it would be better to let this go, but I believe that is a minority voice. The scar is so deep that we can't rest until all these suspects are brought to justice. ""It took a lot of time for things to change here. They were not convicting whites for crimes against blacks. There was a conspiracy of silence. No politician in Alabama would touch the case. There was some hope it would just go away."" Justice is justice Alpha Robertson, 82, whose daughter Carole was one of those killed, said: ""I'm very happy that justice came down and, you know, that's enough, isn't it? You know, I didn't know if it would come in my lifetime."" Danny Ransom, a classmate of one of the girls, said: ""Obviously we've come a long way. You wouldn't have gotten this verdict in the 60s. We've grown up."" Mr Jones said: ""They say that justice delayed is justice denied, and folks, I don't believe that for a minute. Justice delayed is still justice and we've got it here is Birmingham, Alabama."" The case is the latest in a number of civil rights cases reopened in recent years. Byron De La Beckwith was convicted seven years ago of killing the civil rights activist Medgar Evers in 1963, a case that supplied the material for several films. Sam Bowers, a former imperial wizard of the Klan, was found guilty in 1998 of killing a leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People 22 years earlier.",2001-05-03T01:43:39Z,"{'polarity': 0.03363134450090971, 'subjectivity': 0.4022335152769936}",0.4022335152769936

world/2001/jan/23/michaelhoward,Greek bombing raises fears among foreign diplomats,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/23/michaelhoward,"European Union diplomats in Athens complained yesterday that the Greek authorities are stalling on requests for security changes to protect embassy employees, made in the wake of the murder of Brigadier Stephen Saunders. The delays are doing little to assuage growing doubts about Greece's ability to crack down on political violence and terrorism ahead of the 2004 Olympic Games in the capital. Greece has long been regarded as a weak link in the international fight against terrorism. But foreign diplomats in Athens have become increasingly nervous since Sunday night, when a remote-controlled bomb injured Vassilios Michaloliakos, a rightwing member of parliament. No group or person has claimed responsibility for the explosion, which left the opposition MP with facial and chest injuries. But police were yesterday investigating the possibility that it was the work of November 17, the elusive terrorist group responsible for the murder of Saunders, the British military attache in Athens, on June 8. There have been no arrests nor firm leads during a 25-year spell of bombings, rocket attacks and shootings by the November 17 group, which has killed 22 people and injured more than 100. The murder of Saunders sent a shock-wave through the diplomatic community here, prompting western and European embassies to begin an urgent review of their security measures. Diplomats in Athens have been a frequent target for the group, which espouses an explosive mix of Marxism and extreme nationalism. Foreign missions, however, have also borne attacks by other, less lethal, anti-western or anarchist fringe groups. Diplomatic vehicles and those belonging to western businesses are regularly the target of firebombs; the Italian embassy has had eight cars set alight in the past two years. European diplomats cite ""bureaucratic foot-dragging"" and ""a lack of attention"" by the Greek authorities in dealing with their safety concerns. The British embassy, for example, is pressing for the relaxation of rules which limit the number of armour-plated cars permitted for personal protection; the car that Saunders was driving when he was murdered was not reinforced. The Greek government allows one armoured car for every three diplomatic staff. Britain is thought to have asked for an extra three cars to add to their pool. Foreign embassies in London, by contrast, are allowed one armoured car for each diplomat. Other embassies, including those of Germany, Belgium and Italy, have been frustrated by the progress of applications for Greek number plates, which would make their vehicles less of a target. They are also perplexed by the lack of clear guidelines on extra police guards for senior embassy staff. ""It does not give a good message,"" one EU diplomat said. ""Security and safety is supposed to be the government's top priority. We don't doubt the Greek government's political will to fight terrorism, but they don't seem to be able to get their notorious bureaucracy moving. And that could be very dangerous for us."" Another European diplomat complained about Greek double standards. After the arrest of the Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, in February 1999, Greek embassies in several European capitals were stormed by angry Kurds. ""Following that, we did everything we could to enhance the security around Greek embassies,"" he said. ""But that helpfulness doesn't seem to have been reciprocated."" The Greek government has promised that a new law to fight terrorism will go before parliament next month. But anxious diplomats say that until arrests are made, no amount of legislating will convince them that Athens is winning the fight against terrorists.",2001-01-23T03:16:37Z,"{'polarity': -0.02838500388500389, 'subjectivity': 0.22864652441575514}",0.22864652441575514

world/2001/feb/06/saudiarabia,Briton's TV confession adds to mystery of the Saudi car bombs,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/06/saudiarabia,"A British hospital worker was last night facing the death penalty in Saudi Arabia after he appeared on television in Riyadh and admitted planting a car bomb which killed a fellow Briton in November last year. Alexander ""Sandy"" Mitchell, a former soldier employed as an anaesthetics technician at King Fahd hospital, Riyadh, made the dramatic confession in a stage-managed television appearance on Sunday evening. Looking pale and reading haltingly from a script, Mr Mitchell, from Kirkintilloch near Glasgow, claimed to have planted a bomb under a car owned by Christopher Rodway. Mr Rodway, 47, was killed and four others, including his wife, were injured in the blast last year. Human rights groups condemned the parading on television of Mr Mitchell and two other men, a Belgian and a Canadian who also claimed to have been involved, and questioned the methods by which the confessions had been reached. A friend of Mr Mitchell's said he looked like was under the influence of drugs. William Sampson, a Canadian, also confessed to involvement in the explosion, and Raaf Skivens, a Belgian, claimed he had planted a second device which injured six people five days later. British consular officials in Riyadh were last night seeking clarification of Mr Mitchell's situation. He is understood not to have been charged with any offence, though he was originally arrested on December 17 last year in connection with an inquiry into alcohol smuggling. The consulate was not told and only became aware of the arrest when Mr Mitchell's wife, thought to be Thai, visited on January 6 to enquire after her husband. A British consular official visited Mr Mitchell on January 28 and according to a Foreign Office spokesman ""he seemed well"". Mr Mitchell also requested that no details of his background or circumstances be released. Consular officials received no forewarning of the television appearance and for some time were denied consular access to Mr Mitchell and four other Britons arrested at the end of last year as part of the alcohol inquiry. Kelvin Hawkins and his son-in-law David Marin from Greenock, Paul Moss of Merseyside, Ken Hartley and Ron Yates from Bolton are all being held in the kingdom. Amnesty International condemned the display and accused Saudi Arabia of widespread human rights abuses. ""We are always suspicious of any confession obtained by the Saudi Arabian justice system, which routinely uses trickery, torture and deception to obtain them,"" said a spokesman. ""It is disturbing to see these men paraded on TV in this fashion. Reading a statement is no substitute for a proper trial. In most cases in Saudi Arabia you are unlikely even to get a proper lawyer."" Stephen Jakobi, director of campaign group Fair Trials Abroad, said the accused men had lost all chance of a fair trial. ""From experience we know the Saudis regularly abuse prisoners, torturing them or 'relay interrogating' them for 12 to 14 hours at a time, day after day until they don't know which way is up, and then saying 'sign this'. ""There may be some approximation of truth in these statements, but the trial is already over. Whatever happens from now on is simply going through the motions - all the rules of fair trial have been broken and what we have to do now is hope that nothing awful happens."" Mr Jakobi said he hoped the incident would spark a concerted campaign by the international community against summary justice in the kingdom, and said he would be petitioning the European parliament to make representations against Saudi Arabia. The extraordinary TV appearance follows a spate of bombings against westerners in Saudi Arabia since November last year. In addition to the two explosions the men claimed responsibility for, there were further explosions at a Euromarche supermarket in Riyadh and an the eastern city of Al Khobar in December. Forbidden Alcohol is strictly forbidden in Saudi Arabia but there is no mandatory death sentence for alcohol offences unless they are interpreted as ""corruption on earth"" under the kingdom's sharia law. Execution is by public beheading. There were 123 executions in the kingdom last year, for offences including murder, drug use, apostasy and witchcraft. There have been 17 so far this year. No westerner has ever been beheaded in the kingdom. In the expatriate community of Riyadh, Alexander Mitchell - ""Sandy"" to his friends - is known as an affable fellow, a man with good connections who can, if the need arises, pull a few strings. Among his Saudi acquaintances are interior minister Prince Nayef and Riyadh's chief of police. To those who know him, it was therefore all the more amazing when he appeared on Saudi television, apparently confessing to the bombing. ""It's totally bizarre,"" one long-standing friend, who asked not to be named, said yesterday. ""In the pictures of his confession he looks like he's under the influence of drugs. I know this man very very well. He's a very pleasant man."" Prince Nayef, in an interview published yesterday, confirmed that Mr Mitchell, together with a Canadian and a Belgian, will be tried under sharia law which stipulates execution for convicted murderers. Murderers can sometimes avoid execution if relatives of the victim accept blood money in compensation, but Prince Nayef hinted that this might not be applicable. Under Saudi law, he said, there are ""the rights of the families of the dead man and those injured and then there is the public right, which is up to the government"". Saudi television showed the three accused separately as they confessed to planting the explosives in two cars in the Saudi capital last November and detonating them by remote control. Mr Mitchell, who is in his 40s, met Prince Nayef when the minister had an operation at the hospital. Like many other Britons in the kingdom, Mr Mitchell, became caught up in the illicit drinking activities that keep foreigners entertained, usually with the connivance of the Saudi authorities. ""Three years ago, one of the watering holes was raided by mutawwa [religious police] and a woman was arrested,"" a friend recalls. ""Sandy negotiated with the chief of police and helped to get her released six months later."" Mr Mitchell appears to have dived into the world of drink more deeply than most. Busy ""He rented a complete compound of six villas,"" a friend recalls. ""He sublet five of them to expats and ran one villa as a pub. It was directly next to an American military installation, and was as busy as any pub in London."" But it casts little light on why Mr Mitchell and two others now face murder charges. In any case, Mr Mitchell was no longer involved in the drinking den. ""He sold the business last year. As far as I know he wasn't directly involved in selling alcohol that way any more,"" a friend said. There are suggestions that the accused, and Christopher Rodway, the dead Briton who also worked at a hospital in Riyadh, had become entangled in an alcohol turf war. In their televised statements, the three men said they had been ""ordered"" to carry out the bombings - though they did not say who gave the order. Prince Nayef said last night that the kingdom knew who ""the source"" for the explosives was but ""in the interest of the investigation"" could not give more details now. The suspects Alexander ""Sandy"" Mitchell Employed as chief anaesthetics technician at King Fahd hospital, Riyadh, prior to his arrest on December 17 last year. He confessed to planting the car bomb which killed Christopher Rodway. Mitchell, who is in his early 40s, was born in Kirkintilloch, just outside Glasgow, and is believed to have spent some time in the army. Married with one child, he has spent the bulk of the past 20 years abroad, working in Oman and New Zealand before settling in Saudi Arabia. William Sampson A Canadian national born in Glasgow, Sampson worked as a marketing consultant at the Saudi industrial development fund, which provides interest-free, ""soft"" loans to Saudi businessmen to establish factories. Sampson, like Mitchell, has not been charged since his arrest in November, but confessed to exploding the bomb which killed Rodway by remote control. He told Canadian consular officials who visited him on January 24 that he was being treated well. Raaf Skivens Thought to have worked as a trauma coordinator at King Fahd hospital, he said during his confession that he had planted a second bomb after hearing Mitchell and Sampson discussing the explosion that killed Christopher Rodway. The Belgian is said to be well known among the expatriate community in Riyadh and, as a former music student, he has endeared himself to Scottish colleagues by playing the bagpipes.",2001-02-06T02:49:57Z,"{'polarity': 0.05901837745587745, 'subjectivity': 0.30555441353518276}",0.30555441353518276
world/2001/jan/02/israel1,Middle East peace talks close to failure,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/02/israel1,"Egypt, which has been at the heart of negotiations, yesterday declared the Middle East peace plan initiated by Bill Clinton to be virtually over as five Palestinians, including two children, were killed and a car bomb exploded in Israel, injuring more than 40 people, one critically. The Israelis and Palestinians marked the start of the new year by clashings all over the region, with elements on both sides vowing revenge attacks. The militant Palestinian group Hamas threatened a resumption of suicide bombings and Palestinians were braced for a punitive strike from Israel in retaliation for the latest bombings. Amr Moussa, the foreign minister of Egypt, which has been at the centre of negotiations between Israel, Palestine and the US over the last week, gave his most pessimistic assessment yet. Speaking after a meeting with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, Mr Moussa said there were ""no indications"" that a deal could be sealed in the 19 days left before Mr Clinton leaves office. Mr Arafat told the Egyptians he wanted a meeting with Mr Clinton in Washington to clarify the US proposals and look at detailed maps of the territorial arrangements. If such clarification was not forthcoming, he would reject the plan. A meeting was later arranged, possibly in the next 24 hours, but it was not clear whether Mr Clinton would be able to provide what Mr Arafat wanted. An adviser to Mr Arafat who travelled with him to Cairo gave a stark warning to the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak. He said that if Mr Barak fulfilled his threat to separate Israel and the Palestine Authority forcefully, taking big chunks out of the West Bank in the process, it would be war. In clashes on the West Bank in the hours before the new year and throughout yesterday, two Palestinian soldiers were killed in a shoot-out with the Israeli army. A three-year-old child was killed and an 11-year-old died of wounds sustained the previous day. In a separate incident, witnesses said Jewish settlers had driven into Hizma village near Jerusalem in two cars on Sunday and shot dead a Palestinian, Tahrir Rezeq, 22. The car bomb in Israel, near the coastal city of Netanya, about 12 miles (20 kilometres) from Tel Aviv, marks the second time in a week that Palestinian militants have struck inside Israel, which normally avoids the worst of the violence. Moshe Seff, Netanya's fire chief, said three blasts occurred in rapid succession, smashing shop windows. Palestinians marked the anniversary of the New Year's Day founding of the Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation with a call for attacks on Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least 298 Palestinians, 13 Israeli Arabs and 43 other Israelis have been killed in the Palestinian uprising that erupted three months ago. Jewish settlers blocked roads to West Bank Arab villages in anger at Sunday's killing by Palestinian gunmen of Binyamin Kahane, the son of rabbi Meir Kahane, who was himself killed by an Arab in New York a decade ago. Still hoping for a peace breakthrough, Mr Barak told conscripts at an army base: ""We aren't throwing up our hands. What's needed is level-headedness and strong nerves."" But if no accord emerged, ""the Israeli army will be forced to act against all those who act against us in this violent confrontation"". The Palestinian legislative speaker, Ahmed Korei, back from failed talks in Washington, told Reuters: ""If the Americans continue to insist on their position, then in the near future there will be no agreement."" The EU foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, met Mr Barak to discuss Mr Clinton's proposals. ""I think we have a narrow window of opportunity and everybody has to do their best to grasp this opportunity that will never be back,"" he said.

world/2001/jun/03/israel,Sharon's hawks plan for war,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/03/israel,"Even before Friday's devastating suicide bombing of a nightclub queue in Tel Aviv - the worst such outrage against Jews in five years - the mood among hawks in the Cabinet of Ariel Sharon had been turning to thoughts of all-out war. Four car bombs in the past week and a series of shootings of Israeli settlers had marked an upsurge in Palestinian violence in the worst month for Israeli fatalities in the Occupied Territories since November. It was on the mind of Brigadier-General Yisrael Ziv when he called in the defence correspondents of Israel's press for a briefing at the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv early last week. Within the heavily guarded complex off one of Tel Aviv's main streets, Ziv - senior officer in charge of Israel's infantry and paratroop brigades - told the journalists that Israel was 'not so far removed' from full-scale war. He was not, he assured them, making a prediction. It was simply his job to 'prepare for that eventuality'. It may have come sooner than even Ziv expected. The bombing outside the Pacha nightclub killed 17 people, all but one of them recent Russian immigrants, and wounded scores of others. It could not have come at a worse time, in the middle of an urgent debate in Sharon's Cabinet over whether the time had come to reject international calls for restraint and prepare for a proper war. Within 24 hours of Ziv's briefing - and still before Friday's bomb - Israel's Defence Minister, Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, had announced that the Israel Defence Force's presence on the West Bank would be strengthened by special ambush units to protect the bypasses used by Jewish settlers. To add to the febrile mood of crisis, Shin Bet - the Israeli security service - also weighed in, summoning correspondents for a briefing that purported to demonstrate how senior figures in Arafat's police were involved in the manufacture, arming and use of mortars being fired into Jewish areas. Other senior army officers were briefing off the record too. Israel's two-week-old unilateral ceasefire, they said, was an 'operational halt' in an 'ongoing war', a chance for its soldiers to draw breath and prepare for the task ahead. They added that they were waiting for the political green light from Sharon - who came to power in January promising to guarantee Israelis a new security - for a new offensive in the Territories if the Palestinians did not respond with their own cessation of violence. What that offensive might entail has been spelled out in recent days by members of Sharon's security Cabinet, including the hardline Housing Minister Natan Sharansky. He said last week: 'We are in a war where we are not using our strength. I am not saying reconquer Gaza, but we need to fight with all the strength we have against the terrorist infrastructure in the Palestinian Authority.' Former Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu - Sharon's rival for leadership of the Right - has been hardly less equivocal. 'Israel,' he told the Jerusalem Post last week, 'should concentrate its might to eliminate terror infrastructure - to strike radio, television, media, transportation, gas, and weapons reserves, and the PA's economic infrastructure. 'We have not yet used 1 per cent of the power of the IDF. If Arafat continues the terror we will make sure that his terrorist regime will collapse. It is to this end that a unity gov ernment was formed, and it will receive tremendous backing for its actions.' Yesterday the hardliners appeared to have won the day. After a seven-hour emergency Cabinet meeting - remarkable for being held on the Sabbath - leading Cabinet members indicated that Israel was about to end its policy of restraint. And whatever group was ultimately behind the Pacha bombing, one thing is certain: it has played into the hands of those like Sharansky who only supported the Sharon ceasefire for the most cynical of reasons: that it would 'reveal to the world who was really responsible for the violence'. The key question now is whether the international community can persuade Sharon to stay his hand and prevent more carnage. The new Bush administration has already fumbled the issue of its engagement in the Middle East, notably failing to persuade Arafat to respond to the Israeli ceasefire with his own truce, despite the intervention of Secretary of State Colin Powell. In Britain, Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook - in common with other EU leaders - have called for restraint. There is little evidence of any meaningful intervention. The immediate response of Arafat, under intense pressure from the Americans and also from the visiting German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, was to condemn the bombing and commit Palestinians to do their utmost to implement a ceasefire in the conflict with Israel. His offer was rejected by Israeli Cabinet Ministers, who said they would not take it seriously unless Arafat arrested Islamic militants. While Sharon and others on the right blame Arafat for orchestrating the violence, the truth is that both sides may have now gone too far to turn back. Analysts are dubious about the amount of control Arafat can actually exert over the suicide bombers of Islamic Jihad and Hamas, whose leaders he released from his prisons at the beginning of the intifada . 'When he released Islamic extremists from the Palestinian prisons,' said one Western diplomat, 'he opened a Pandora's box. He may find it impossible to close it.'

world/2001/mar/27/israel2,Palestinian suicide bomber attacks Jerusalem,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/27/israel2,"Palestinian militants set off two explosions in Jerusalem today, killing the suicide bomber responsible for the second attack and injuring 22 others. The explosions came six hours apart, the first detonated by remote control near a shopping mall and the second by a man with explosives strapped to his body who blew himself up next a bus. Yesterday Palestinian snipers killed a 10-month-old girl in Hebron. The attacks coincided with the start of the Arab League summit in Jordan, where the issue of Palestine is expected to be a key focus, and placed growing pressure on the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, to retaliate. Mr Sharon was elected last month on a promise to restore security to Israelis, but the government has been reluctant to respond during the summit. ""We have a war here,"" said Jerusalem's mayor, Ehud Olmert, adding that the government had expected an escalation of violence during the Arab summit. A spokesman for Mr Sharon, speaking before the second bombing, said that Israel would retaliate, but refused to say what steps the government would take. ""I can assure them [the Palestinians] that the response ... will be swift and will be coming,"" he said. Commenting from the summit in Amman late yesterday, the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, made no reference to the killing of the Israeli girl, only denouncing Israel's immediate response - the shelling of the Hebron neighbourhood of Abu Sneineh, from which the shots on the Jewish enclave had been fired. Seven Palestinians were hurt in the shelling. Today's explosion close to the bus went off shortly after 1pm local time (11am GMT) in French Hill, a Jewish neighbourhood in a disputed part of northern Jerusalem. Flames shot up the right-hand side of the bus and its back windows were blown out. Danny Sarero, 35, said he was standing a few metres away from the bus when he heard the explosion. ""The next thing I knew I saw a person cut in two, a body and a head lying in the street. I've never seen such a thing. Pieces of flesh strewn around for 50 metres,"" Mr Sarero said. ""I'm in shock."" In a leaflet sent to news agencies, a previously unknown Palestinian group calling itself the Popular Army Front claimed responsibility for the blast. The militant Islamic Jihad group, meanwhile, said it was responsible for a car bomb that exploded at 7.40am (5.40am GMT) in Talpiot, a commercial neighbourhood in southern Jerusalem. Three passengers in a bus that was passing by at the time of the explosion were slightly hurt.

The assassination of Santiago Oleaga, 54, financial director of the conservative newspaper Diario Vasco, was Eta's first killing since its political ally, the Euskal Herritarok party, lost half its seats in elections to the regional parliament on May 13 - its worst result ever. Mr Oleaga received seven pistol shots in the head as he parked his car near a hospital in San Sebastian early yesterday. He was Eta's eighth victim in Spain so far this year. His newspaper, part of the Bilbao-based Correo group, is one of a number of anti-separatist publications and broadcasters whose staff are now being pursued by Eta. Last year Eta killed a columnist for the newspaper El Mundo, Jose Luis Lopez de Lacalle. It has also carried out attacks on journalists from the newspaper El Pais, the magazine Tiempo, state radio RNE and Antena 3 television. Some journalists now have round-the-clock protection from armed guards. Last week Eta sent a letter-bomb to Gorka Landaburu, a Basque journalist who works for the magazine Cambio 16. He lost two fingers when the bomb blew up as he opened it. Eta, which already targets politicians, judges, academics, police and members of the armed forces, has now also added the security guards who protect them to its target list. On Tuesday, a security guard at the University of the Basque Country, many of whose academics have been threatened by Eta, discovered a bomb under the driver's seat of his car. ""Eta wants to win back by killing what it lost at thepolls,"" said Juan Jose Ibarretxe, the acting regional premier, whose moderate Basque Nationalist party won the regional elections. Mr Ibarretxe, whose previous minority government depended on Euskal Herritarok's support, has said that this time the separatists will be excluded unless they denounce Eta's violence.

world/2001/mar/25/russia.usa,America turns the clock back to Cold War returns to return as as Bush gets tough,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/25/russia.usa,"At dawn on a small wooden bridge in New Mexico, Klaus Fuchs once passed the blueprint for the H-bomb to Harry Gold, his handler from President Vladimir Putin's old employer, the KGB. And it was on a small wooden bridge in Virginia that Robert Hanssen, Russia's recently arrested spy within the FBI, would meet his man from Moscow's secret services. But this weekend the bridges between Washington and Moscow - and with Beijing too - are collapsing as George W. Bush rattles the sabres of a new Cold War across Europe and the Pacific. In an echo from another time, four senior Russian envoys will leave Washington during the coming days, with a further 46 to follow before the muggy summer descends on the Potomac. And in strict accordance with the rules of Cold War, Russia's retort is swift and symmetrical: four senior Americans to leave imminently, with 46 to follow after the ice thaws on the Moskva. And no sooner had the order for them to leave been handed to Russian Ambassador Yuri Ashakov than US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld took another bellicose stride across the Pacific, towards a new arms race with China - giving Bush a 90-minute lecture on his plans to overhaul America's arsenal to face the new Chinese threat. Based on the premise that the United States' Far Eastern flank is the most likely theatre for military operations, Rumsfeld said that he wants to replace dependence on aircraft carriers and short-range fighters with long-range bombers capable of flying across the world's widest sea to fight and win a nuclear war. The Rumsfeld briefing coincides with a White House pledge that the US will push ahead with arms sales to Taiwan. The Chinese have thus far responded with cryptic remarks about continued friendship, but the formality was shattered in an interview with President Jiang Zemin in the Washington Post urging the US to halt the sale, which would cause his own country to accelerate its military modernisation programme. 'The more weapons you sell,' he said, 'the more we will prepare ourselves in terms of national defence.' The tit-for-tat with Russia and belligerent glare towards China are partial responses to a question that America thought might be answered at the end of the Bush administration's first 100 days, but to which the first 60 have already articulately replied: 'Will the real George Bush please stand up?' For all the talk about a 'gridlock' that might follow his contested election victory, Bush has embarked on a brazen agenda of conservative policies at home and combative international gestures. On the domestic front, he has ridden roughshod over his opponents on tax cuts, the environment and - late on Friday night - organised labour, with a new Executive Order overriding eight years of work safety legislation compiled by the Clinton administration. Overseas, Bush has ig-nored European allies, bombed Iraq and spurned the North Koreans and Palestinians. But the most serious of these struts onto the international stage, about which he reportedly knew nothing until the final days of his campaign, are the gauntlets hurled last week into the faces of Russia and China. Mutual expulsions are a carefully choreographed routine. A diplomatic persona non grata is rarely, if ever, punished - they are 'caught' and sent packing while governments go after their own kind. But these are the largest such actions taken since the espionage 'bloodbath' of 1986 and the most aggressive since the collapse of the Soviet Union. US counter-intelligence claims that post-Soviet Russia has mobilised a determined build-up of espionage in the US out of proportion to American intelligence activity. 'They've flooded the zone,' said David Major, a former FBI counter-intelligence official as part of a PR blitz, 'and as long as they continue flooding the zone it puts a strain on American counter-intelligence.' Other officials say that Putin has strengthened his military intelligence web in the USA. But there is manipulation in these alerts. During Cold War days, a communication line ran between the KGB and CIA, 'the Gavrilov Channel', to maintain checks and balances on numbers operating on each side. Last week the Washington station chief of the post-communist SVR service was reportedly left intact - a signal that Bush accepts the Gavrilov principle and that the US and Russia need each other's intelligence services in modern combat against drugs, fraud and organised crime. Although CIA director George Tenet supported the expulsions, the agency itself was opposed, said one source, knowing that they would provoke retaliation and reduce CIA numbers in Russia. To real experts, the core issue is not the Boy's Own melodrama of espionage but the far more perilous monitoring of Russia's isolated but vast nuclear arsenal and American commitment to the bilateral co-operation programme that destroys warheads and stops proliferation. A recent element in the degeneration of Russo-American relations was Rumsfeld's view of Russia as a 'nation of proliferators', and his deputy Paul Wolfowitz's that 'these people will do anything for money' - sneers which run contrary to most experts agreeing that miraculously few 'loose nukes' have found illegal passage out of Russia. Among the leading observers of Russia is Susan Eisenhower, director of the Eisenhower Foundation and granddaughter of Ike - general, President and founder of Nato. Interviewed by The Observer on Friday, Eisenhower questioned the validity of the Hanssen panic and warned: 'The irony is that the US is in a more vulnerable position than the Russians. 'We have hundreds of professional personnel all over the most remote and sensitive nuclear sites in Russia under the co-operation treaties. The big issue is access to sensitive sites, and this is contingent on the good grace of the Russian government. 'But now,' she continued, 'the Russians have the absolute right to say at any time ""for security reasons we can't continue to allow you access to our most sensitive sites"".' Eisenhower added: 'There are a number of ways to handle this situation, and one has to wonder why the administration decided to do so this way. What else did they expect the Russians to do? It probably means that the administration is not as sympathetic to the monitoring co-operation programme as was the case in the past, and that is very serious indeed. 'The Russians are very prideful of the fact that there has been so little proliferation, and it is dangerous for the US to undermine that.' Bush is seen as using the Hanssen case as a pretext to reduce Russia's intelligence presence in America, but experts regard the rationale as political. The expulsions are the latest in a rapid series of antagonisms, including the missile defence screen, threats to cease aid and a meeting last week with Chechen 'ambassador' to Washington Ilyas Akhmatov which - whatever the merits of the case - would be equivalent through British eyes to meeting the IRA. Putin has thrown his own challenges: arms trading with Iran, repression in Chechnya and tacit backing for the tyrannies in Belarus and Ukraine. The engine behind Bush's foreign policy, National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice, has been spoiling for a fight with Moscow for years - long before she bewitched Bush with her ability to talk baseball and had a view of Russia that applied whether the country was communist or not. Rice is a lifelong hawk who switched from the Democrats to Republicans because of Jimmy Carter's 'feeble' response to the invasion of Afghanistan, has long insisted that Russia 'modify' the bedrock ABM treaty of 1972 and accused Bill Clinton of 'romanticism' in his relations. She opposed détente and aid programmes by the World Bank and IMF, and her finest hour came when these were discredited by corruption scandals. But Rice's last experience in office was during the final years of the communist regime and, says one former Russian desk official in the Clinton State Department: 'Condie is not a Russian expert, she's a good Soviet-ologist, which is not the same thing.' Russia is not the only country facing Bush's new hard line. Briefing The Observer two weeks ago, Bush's spokesman Ari Fleischer made it clear that European objections to the missile defence screen would make no difference to the ultimate US objectives; negotiations with North Korea have been frozen. And last week the US dealt a triple blow to the world's fastest-emerging power, China. As Rumsfeld submitted his defence proposals, Bush made it clear that he will push ahead with selling the Aegis missile radar system to Taiwan - enabling the island to steal a military edge over the mainland - which China stresses will rupture relations between Beijing and Washington. This he did while shaking hands with Chinese Deputy Premier Qian Qichen, who warned against the Taiwan sale and was told by his host that the warmth of the Clinton era would be replaced by a policy that was 'respectful' but 'firm'. Rumsfeld also briefed senior Pentagon officers when their chief of staff, General Henry Shelton, was away - reflecting the domination of military affairs by White House political thinking and exclusion of senior military from policy-making. Rumsfeld told them that operating across the Pacific will require an additional emphasis on 'long-range power projection' - which means dispatching bombers and firepower across thousands of miles. Strategically, the shift requires building a new generation of long-range bombers which may or may not be an unmanned enhancement of the B-52 warhorse that the US has been making since 1954 and is commissioned until 2020. Politically, it means infuriating and alarming the Chinese. The Beijing government's greeting to Washington upon Bush's inauguration stressed that 'we don't like your national missile defence, but we are willing to talk about it. We believe our differences must be subordinate to our common interests - but with one exception. If you take the crucial step towards extending missile defence to Taiwan - that is a step too far'. Although Rumsfeld's proposals do not specifically extend the screen to cover Taiwan, it does swing America's military posture from the European theatre arraigned against Russia to a more aggressive readiness to fight a war across the Pacific, as Russia apparently weakens and China is perceived to be strengthening its nuclear arsenal. Between the two, the United States is closer to battle stations and more isolated than any time since Bush's father, George H, hailed the dawn of the 'New World Order' a decade ago. • Additional reporting by Amelia Gentleman in Moscow and by John Gittings in Shanghai Related articles World Dispatch: Russia reacts angrily to 'spy' expulsions 22.03.2001: Timeline of 'spy' expulsions 04.03.2001: Alarm as Dublin trains 'KGB' 26.02.2001: Russian faces spy trial over UK trip 23.02.2001: Spy claim forces lie-test rethink 25.02.2001:The spy who loved being out in the Cold Useful links Russian embassy in Washington DC US embassy in Moscow FBI FBI press release on Robert Hanssen's arrest Special operations.com The 1948 Alger Hiss spy case The 1951 Rosenberg spy case",2001-03-25T03:54:58Z,"{'polarity': 0.04425802435356577, 'subjectivity': 0.4312382415885601}",0.4312382415885601
world/2001/apr/06/rorycarroll,Bin Laden suspects seized in Europe,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/06/rorycarroll,"Police in Italy and Germany have broken up a suspected terrorist cell whose members are alleged by investigating magistrates to have plotted bomb attacks across Europe on behalf of the Islamic militant Osama bin Laden. But the raids that ran into the early hours yesterday failed to net five suspects who were still being hunted in Italy last night. The six men who were seized are accused of targeting Strasbourg's Gothic cathedral. In Milan and the nearby town of Busto Arsizio, five Tunisians were arrested on suspicion of supplying arms and false documents. The sixth man was arrested in Germany. ""For the first time, we believe we can determine a direct link between Islamic terrorist cells and training camps in Afghanistan,"" said Stefano Dambruoso, one of two investigating magistrates in the case. Investigators said that Lombardy, the region where the arrests took place, was being used to supply the operational needs - weapons and paperwork - of extremists trained in Afghanistan and now operating in Britain, Germany, France and Belgium. Italy's interior minister, Enzo Bianco, hailed police forces in Europe and the United States, plus Italy's two main intelligence agencies, Sismi and Sisde, for pooling information and acting on it. ""The nerve centre of an organisation which could carry out attacks in Europe has been exposed. Police have uncovered a very dangerous unit ready [to carry out] terrorist acts. We are convinced we have defeated a mastermind of Islamic terrorism."" Two of the suspects arrested in Italy were said to be on the run after serving time in Jordan and Tunisia. All five are being held in Milan's San Vittore prison while charges of belonging to a criminal organisation, trafficking in arms and falsifying documents are prepared. They were named as Essid Sami Ben Khemais, 32, Charaabi Tarek, 30, Bouchoucha Moktar, 31, Kammon Medhi, 32, and Ben Soltane Adel, 30. They shared houses in Viale Bligny in Milan, and Via Dubini in Busto Arsizio. The man arrested in Germany, believed to be Algerian, was accused of helping them to prepare a Christmas atrocity in the French city of Strasbourg, where the European parliament sits.

world/2001/may/14/internationalcrime.unitednations,Leak shows nuclear trafficking doubled,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/14/internationalcrime.unitednations,"The worldwide smuggling of radioactive materials has reportedly doubled in the last five years, according to a leaked United Nations study, and there are now thought to be more than 100 terrorist organisations capable of developing a rudimentary atomic bomb. The report, drawn up by the UN's terrorism prevention branch and detailed in the Sunday Herald newspaper, reveals that since 1993 there have been 550 recorded incidents of trafficking of nuclear materials across the globe. Most of the incidents involved materials such as radioactive scrap metal but one in 10 is said to have included weapons-grade plutonium or uranium. The study quotes the head of the UN anti-terrorism unit, Alex Schmid, as warning that much of the nuclear material in the former Soviet republics is poorly protected and the risk of some being stolen is growing. ""Time might not be on our side,"" Mr Schmid is reported as saying. ""The amount of plutonium in the world is increasing. Vigorous efforts need to be made to keep the nuclear genie in the bottle and out of the hands of terrorists."" Mr Schmid added: ""Most of the weapons-usable nuclear materials in the kilogram range are stored in nearly 400 buildings which are not all guarded in the way they should be guarded. This quantity of dangerous but potentially precious materials offers temptation for adventurers and desperados."" The 40-page report, commissioned by the international atomic eneregy agency, claims that there are 130 terrorist organisations listed by the US department of state as posing a potential nuclear, chemical or biological threat. They include 55 ethnic groups, 50 religious groups, 20 left-wing groups and five right-wing groups. The list includes Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaida in Afghanistan and the Aum Shinrikyo cult in Japan.

world/2001/may/18/israel,Suicide bomber kills four in Israeli mall,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/18/israel,"A Palestinian suicide bomber set off a powerful explosive today at the entrance to an Israeli shopping mall, killing himself and at least four more people, and wounding more than 40. The explosion reverberated through the coastal city of Netanya. A large cloud of black smoke rose over the area of the blast as ambulances raced to the scene. Militant Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility at a rally in Gaza today, saying the attack was the seventh in a planned series of ten bombings. A senior Palestinian security official identified the bomber as Mahmoud Ahmed Marmash, 21, from the West Bank town of Tulkarm. The group's founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, said Israel was ""reaping the violence it has planted"". Witnesses said that the bomber had detonated explosives at the entrance to the Sharon mall near the centre of Netanya. The city, 20 miles north of Tel Aviv and just 6 miles from the West Bank, has been the scene of several bomb attacks by Palestinian militants in the past. ""I saw a young man who looked like an Arab wearing a huge blue jacket and I said, 'Look, that's a terrorist',"" an eyewitness told an Israeli radio station. She said she told police, but the bomb went off before they arrived. ""It was a huge explosion,"" she said. Another witness described the aftermath of the bombing as a horrible scene. ""It was a very big blast and I think that many people were killed,"" she said. Witnesses said that the bomber tried to get into the mall but security guards stopped him entering. The shopping mall was crowded with shoppers at midday Friday, as people prepared for the Jewish Sabbath, which begins at sundown. After the explosion, police cleared people out of the mall and closed off the area. Israeli security forces have been on high alert for possible attacks by Palestinian militants during the nearly eight months of violence between Israel and the Palestinians.

world/2001/may/23/israel5,Israel's 'ceasefire' broken,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/23/israel5,"Israel's ""unilateral ceasefire"" declaration announced yesterday appeared to have crumbled this morning as the Israeli army reportedly launched tank raids on three Palestinian-controlled areas in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, said on Tuesday that he had instructed the army not to take offensive action against the Palestinians and ""to open fire only in cases of life-threatening danger"". The Palestinians responded by dismissing the ceasefire as ""a trick"", arguing that an Israeli withdrawal from the territories seized in the 1967 war and the removal of all settlements were the only ways to end the conflict. Palestinian cabinet secretary Ahmed Abdel Rahman said: ""It is a trick, a manoeuvre on top of Sharon's trick of his so-called approval of the Mitchell report."" ""Talk of a ceasefire is misleading because actually there is only aggression against the Palestinian people. It's not a war that requires a ceasefire,"" he said, arguing that the Palestinians had a ""legitimate right"" to resist the occupation. Mr Sharon's ceasefire orders followed the publication of the Mitchell report, which called for an ""immediate and unconditional end to violence"" and recommended an end to Israeli settlement activity. But Mr Sharon refused to back down on the settlement issue and yesterday Israel made a number of armed incursions into Palestinian-run land in the Gaza Strip. This morning a bomb exploded in the path of an Israeli army patrol and troops retaliated with gunfire. A building, which Israel claimed was a bomb-making centre and the Palestinians said was just a metal factory, was also attacked. There are additional fears of a new battlefront developing on the northern border of Israel, after the Jewish state warned Syria that it would retaliate were Lebanese guerrillas to enter its territory. The move comes a year after Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon. Meanwhile, the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, was due in Paris this morning for talks with French leaders on efforts to end the conflict. Mr Arafat and peace negotiator Saeb Erakat are meeting the French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, the president, Jacques Chirac, and the foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine. Mr Sharon is due in Paris for a similar meeting in two weeks.

world/2001/feb/08/israel5,Sharon halts peace process in wake of blast,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/08/israel5,"Israel's prime minister-elect, Ariel Sharon, has responded to a suspected car bomb explosion in west Jerusalem today by pledging that he will not resume peace talks until the violence ends. No one was seriously hurt in the blast which took place at 4:40pm local time (2.40pm GMT) in an ultra-orthodox Jewish neighbourhood. Only hours before the blast, Mr Sharon angered Palestinians by refusing to resume peace talks where they left off with the outgoing administration of Ehud Barak. He said: ""I will try to advance the peace process, but that depends on an absolute halt to violence. The peace negotiations are important, and the government will do everything to that end, but terrorism and violence must cease."" No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but police said a motorcycle patrol arrested two men who were fleeing the area on foot. Police added that because the car caught fire before exploding, they could not rule out the possibility that the blast was caused by mechanical problems with the vehicle. Shimon Hagai, a witness, said parts of the car flew up to the height of about four stories. He said the explosions were 20 seconds apart and clouds of smoke rose high into the air. The violence follows the election yesterday of veteran rightwinger Mr Sharon, who sparked four months of bloody clashes with the Palestinians when he visited a Muslim holy site in Jerusalem in September. Mr Barak blamed Palestinians for today's alleged attack, and said the explosion was a strong message to the new government about the future of the peace process. Mr Sharon further provoked Palestinian anger when he said earlier today that he would not honour agreements reached between Mr Barak's administration and Palestinian negotiators. Mr Barak had drawn near to an agreement with Palestinian representatives although no final accord had been signed when talks broke off just before the election. Mr Barak had put the partitioning of Jerusalem on the table, an unprecedented step. Mr Sharon has said he will not consider a peace deal that divides Jerusalem. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat, echoing the views of the Palestinian leadership following a meeting late yesterday, said if Mr Sharon wants to resume the peace process it must be from where it was suspended by Mr Barak. ""There is no turning back, as Sharon would like to,"" he said.

world/2001/mar/31/spain.ewenmacaskill,Eta threat to tourists,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/31/spain.ewenmacaskill,"The Foreign Office yesterday issued a warning to British tourists planning holidays in Spain this year after the armed Basque separatist group Eta threatened holidaymakers. In a communique published by several Basque newspapers, Eta said it would continue its bombing campaign of resort towns and told tourists to stay away or face ""undesirable consequences"". The threat came two weeks after a police officer was killed in the Costa Brava resort town of Roses, eastern Spain, when an Eta car bomb exploded outside a hotel. On the same day police discovered a second car bomb in the coastal resort of Gandia, near Valencia. Eta's aim is to undermine Spain's tourist industry, the third biggest in the world. Twelve million visitors from Britain are expected this year in addition to the 700,000 Britons who live in the country. After the Eta statement, the Foreign Office revised its travel advice. It said: ""Statistically, the threat to British citizens in Spain remains very low but British nationals, residents and visitors throughout Spain should be aware there is a risk, albeit very small."" A spokesperson said: ""We are not telling people not to go but calling people's attention to the small risk."" Judith Watson, a spokesperson for the Association of British Tourist Agents, said Eta had been around for 40 years and ""fortunately there have been no serious incidents in volving tourists"". She said that although she could not be 100% sure that someone would not be in ""the wrong place at the wrong time"", the chances of tourists ending up as casualties of terrorism were remote. Thomson said it ""takes the safety of its customers extremely seriously and is currently monitoring the situation closely"", but added: ""There is no reason why customers' holidays should be in any way affected. Normal booking conditions for amendments and cancellations apply. ""The only official advice is, as normal, that customers should be alert and report anything suspicious to the police immediately. The advice applies to many destinations."" The tourist trade can be vulnerable to terrorist attack. The Egyptian trade is only now be ginning to recover from a massacre and Turkey too has been hit by threats. A previous Eta campaign to plant bombs on beaches did not deter tourists, according to the industry. In 1996, a bomb exploded in Reus airport, a resort town in north-eastern Spain, injuring 35 tourists. Most were British. Half a dozen bombs were also planted on the Costa del Sol and other southern resorts that year, without harming anyone. The next year tourist resorts on the Costa Brava, including Lloret del Mar and Malgrat del Mar, were targeted. Again nobody was harmed. Police have warned that Eta is now preparing its car bombs in France, making resorts in the north of Spain more likely to be targeted.",2001-03-30T23:43:37Z,"{'polarity': -0.003896103896103895, 'subjectivity': 0.37179894179894185}",0.37179894179894185
world/2001/may/25/israel1,Wedding hall collapse kills at least 15,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/25/israel1,"At least 15 people were killed when a three-storey wedding hall in west Jerusalem collapsed late last night. Guests were left clinging to the side of the building waiting for rescuers to arrive. Witnesses said 700 people were attending the event at the Versailles wedding hall when the building collapsed. The Jerusalem police commander Miki Levy said the collapse was due to a ""structural failure"" and was ""absolutely not"" a bomb. He added that 247 people had been taken to hospital but there were signs of life from people trapped under the rubble and a special Israeli army rescue unit was at the scene. One of the rescue workers, Haggai Lavie, 25, said that at least three bodies had been removed from the wreckage, and many more were trapped beneath huge concrete slabs. The wedding celebrations were on the top floor of the building, and the two floors below were not being used. The concrete floor collapsed and crashed through the floors below, leaving a gaping, three-storey hole with metal reinforcement cables hanging at twisted angles from the sides. The front of the hall remained eerily intact, with its name still illuminated in large, blue letters. Efraim Meiran, a relative of the groom, said: ""It was like an atom bomb. A hole opened up and people fell through; tables of people - one 20 centimetres from us - and the entire band disappeared."" Sara Pinhas, another of the groom's relatives, said that the dancers had just lifted the father of the bride on a chair when suddenly he fell, ""and then we felt the whole building collapse, everything fell down. We managed to climb down the side of the building."" ""People were dancing and all of a sudden the dance floor collapsed, and all the tables around it fell through,"" said Rami Mordechai, who told Israel television that he was at the wedding but some distance from the part that buckled at the centre of the building. ""People were flying through the air, the orchestra, the loudspeakers, everything fell,"" Efraim Rino said. Rescue workers arrived in minutes. Victims who had been pulled from the rubble were lined up on stretchers awaiting ambulances to take them to hospitals. Many were unconscious and bleeding. Relatives gathered in front of Jerusalem hospitals, desperately seeking news. Others said they had helped pull people out of the wreckage of the building before they were taken to the hospitals themselves. Doctors said there were many children among the injured, including a three-month-old baby. The mayor of Jerusalem Ehud Olmert said, ""This is a terrible, terrible tragedy.""

world/2001/jun/10/eu.politics2,Will Hutton: European integration a certainty,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/10/eu.politics2,"Tomorrow, Timothy McVeigh, the man whose bomb killed 168 people in the federal government offices in Oklahoma City in 1995, will be executed. Every aspect of his last hours - what he said, what he ate and his demeanour as he faced death - will be reported in meticulous detail. It is a quintessential story from contemporary America, unrepeatable in any other country because nowhere else breeds the anti-government ideology and culture which could persuade a man like McVeigh that the fight against 'federal tyranny' justified taking the lives of 168 innocent people. For McVeigh and his supporters are not alone. They are part of a demi-monde of militias, living all over the west and the south of the United States, training themselves, like their imagined historical counterparts who fought for independence, to resist the reach of the federal government, in particular the way it limits the use of guns and levies taxes. It all may seem light years away from the British general election result, but the culture that bred McVeigh and the recent, calamitous course of British right-wing politics are linked by a golden thread. For the militias have the same roots in the ultra neo-conservatism that has fuelled the rise of the right wing of the Republican Party over the last 30 years, and which has had such a malign influence on the wider American and British Right. The militias legitimise themselves by insisting that they are defenders of the canons of liberty. 'God Bless America' declares the website of one of the largest, the Montana militia (www.militiaofmontana.com) as it justifies its permanent readiness to take arms to defend American civilisation against government. It is this same hotch-potch of ultra anti-statism and appeal to individuals to demonstrate their good character by standing against the state that underlines the philosophic credo of the intellectual hero of US neo-conservatism, Leo Strauss, the man to whom many of the advisers and some of the more influential members of George Bush's Cabinet openly acknowledge their intellectual debt. Strauss, who died in 1973, is the grandfather of the right-wing revolution. He argued that the foundation of a good society is not equality or justice, but the moral character of the individuals who constitute it. What makes government bad is that it undermines moral character. It reduces the impact of individuals having to face up to the consequences of their actions, because, ultimately, to be poor or rich reflects the individual's own worth. The genius of the American Right has been to link this philosophy to free market economics and the principles of the American way while making an explicit appeal to America's entrenched racism. Thus, free markets are not only economically efficient, they are morally superior to any form of managed markets or social democracy because they permit the expression of individual character. To be rich is to be virtuous; to be poor is to be of poor character. To redistribute money from the rich to give to the poor is immoral, because it justifies the bad character possessed by the poor. To argue against taxing white suburbs to provide welfare entitlements for the black inner city is not racist; it is about encouraging good character. So it is that Bush can justify his tax cuts that favour the rich while arguing that the poor need the support not of the government, but of faith-based groups and the teaching of the Bible which will improve their moral characters. While Reagan, Newt Gingrich and now Bush have been applying the Straussian cocktail to put the Democrats on the permanent political defensive, out in the boondocks the militias were using the same philosophy to defend freedom to own guns, plan military assaults on federal installations and prevent the collapse of America. If the highbrow intellectuals in Washington could do it, so could they. The whole discourse of American politics has been savagely pulled to the Right. Until Thursday night, Britain was drifting the same way. British Conservatives (and some in New Labour) thought the same philosophy, from limiting progressive taxation to arguing that prison works (it locks up those of bad character), could be imported wholesale into Britain, even though we have none of the same constitutional and cultural tinder that might support it. There is no constitution that can legitimise anti-statism in the same way; there is no tradition of the frontier that lionises individualism; only a tiny minority of Britons understand the appeal of religious fundamentalism in which individual souls are redeemed by individual revelation; there is no 250-year tradition of slavery. The preconditions that have found ultra-conservatism support in America do not work here. For Britain does not lie halfway between America and Europe. Britain is unambiguously European. We accept the legitimacy of the state; indeed, we want it to underwrite our education, health and transport systems along with our incomes when we are unlucky or grow old. We want redistribution of income to improve equality. We do not accept that riches or poverty are proof of individual worth or lack of worth. Nor is our criminal justice system organised around the same Old Testament vengefulness as America's. This, I think, is the fundamental lesson of the general election and why, in the end, Euroscepticism and anti-statism do not work in Britain; quite simply, we are Europeans, our destiny lies there and while we may protest at the consequences, at bottom we know it. If the Conservative Party wants to reclaim the centre ground it is not just a question of being more liberal on social issues and supporting public services; it is about making its peace with Europe. New Labour needs to recognise the profundity of what has happened as well. There are good economic reasons for joining the euro, but what clinches the case is that politically and philosophically we belong to Europe, and we cannot permit its further integration to take place without us. Mr Blair must challenge the objections of his Chancellor and commit to a referendum this time next year. And while we recoil from what McVeigh did and the manner of his execution, we can be even more certain we will win the European argument. We are not surrogate Americans. We are Europeans.",2001-06-10T13:11:58Z,"{'polarity': 0.10264406846975649, 'subjectivity': 0.37008121847571396}",0.37008121847571396
world/2001/feb/09/israel,Blast tests Sharon's resolve,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/09/israel,"A car bomb in an ultra-orthodox Jewish neighbourhood of Jerusalem put the mettle of hardliner Ariel Sharon to the test yesterday, less than 48 hours after his huge election victory. Mr Sharon ducked the issue, saying that the blast in Beit Israel, which injured one woman and left nine others in shock, was a ""tragedy"", but that it was up to the prime minister, Ehud Barak, to respond as he remains in charge until a new government is formed. But Mr Sharon, who rode to power promising to make Israelis feel safe from a violent Palestinian uprising, added: ""It obliges us to unite in order to work in a determined way against terror."" He also reaffirmed his policy of holding no talks with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, until the uprising ends. Two previously unknown groups, the Popular Palestinian Resistance Forces and the Victims of Sabra and Shatila, claimed responsibility for the bomb, which exploded near Jerusalem's largest yeshiva, or religious seminary, attended by hundreds of overseas students. By tradition, the ultra-orthodox do not vote in Israeli elections, and the people of Beit Israel had no hand in Mr Sharon's win. But even here, they were quick to realise the challenge posed to Mr Sharon. ""It's a very hard position for the new prime minister. Whatever he does he will get criticised. If he does not fight, he will seem weaker than Mr Barak, but if he fights back, the world will say he is using excessive force,"" said Sruly Bernstein, a yeshiva student from Australia. Mr Sharon has spent his first hours trying to reassure a world that knows him as the man who orchestrated Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. But a senior adviser, Zalman Shoval, said Mr Sharon rejected the Palestinian demand to pick up the thread of negotiations from last month's talks at the Red Sea resort of Taba, where the two sides came close to agreement on territory and other issues. Mr Shoval is to visit Washington next week to gauge the response of the Bush administration to the rolling back of the peace process. Mr Sharon turned his attention to the domestic front yesterday, with Likud party negotiators opening talks with Mr Barak's Labour party on forming a national unity government. An alliance with Labour would give Mr Sharon greater stability in the fractured parliament he inherited from Mr Barak. But some Labour leaders are balking at the prospect of joining a coalition with partners far more extreme than Mr Sharon.",2001-02-09T03:29:05Z,"{'polarity': 0.08367424242424243, 'subjectivity': 0.4201641414141414}",0.4201641414141414

A spokesman for the Palestinian Authority, Famir Rantissi, said: ""Unfortunately, the Israelis are not serious about a ceasefire."" Israel's foreign minister, Shimon Peres, who arrived in the US yesterday, is to meet President George Bush tomorrow to discuss the truce proposal, which is part of a peace plan put forward by Jordan and Egypt. Under the plan, Israel would also lift its economic blockade of Palestinian areas. But the plan also proposes a return to negotiations based on the offers on the table at Taba in February: defined borders, Jewish settlements and the future of Jerusalem. Israel is adamant that those terms, put forward under the former prime minister, Ehud Barak, no longer apply. The Israeli foreign ministry said that Mr Peres expected a Palestinian response to the new proposals on his return to Israel on Thursday. But Mr Rantissi said: ""The ball is still in their court."" The Palestinians accepted a ceasefire in principle, he said, but Tel Aviv was not prepared to accept the whole peace plan. ""They can't take out the bits that do not suit them,"" he said. Meanwhile, a bomb exploded in a parked car owned by a Jewish settler in the Gaza Strip yesterday. The Israeli army said that a Palestinian was killed and another hurt. Near Qalqilya, on the West Bank, a man wanted by the Israelis, was shot and killed. The Israeli army said that Adnan Odeh had tried to avoid arrest.

world/2001/may/28/israel,US urges Arafat to rein in the bombers,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/28/israel,"The new US envoy to the Middle East, William Burns, has urged the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to stop ""terrorist attacks"", after two car bombs shook a shopping and entertainment area of central Jerusalem, near the city police headquarters, yesterday. There were no serious injuries in either explosion. The second, at 9am, was packed with mortar shells and nails. Witnesses said they heard several small explosions, following a big one which sent up huge clouds of black smoke. The police said 31 people were slightly injured, most suffering from shock. The normally crowded area was relatively quiet on the eve of the Jewish Shavuot holiday. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack. A mortar shell from the exploding car landed in a public square, where police sappers rushed to disarm it. The police said this was the first time such a cocktail of explosives had been used in a car bomb in Israel. The first bomb exploded in the Russian Compound nightclub district at midnight while there were hundreds of young people in discos and bars. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility and said it was aimed at the police station to avenge the deaths of ""Palestinian martyrs"". At his meeting with Mr Arafat in Ramallah Mr Burns said the US strongly condemned the blasts and urged Mr Arafat ""to do everything possible"" to stop such attacks. He admitted that implementing last week's report by the fact-finding mission led by the former US senator George Mitchell, which calls for an immediate ceasefire, was ""an extremely complex and difficult challenge to both parties"". Yesterday the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, told reporters in the Ugandan capital, Kampala: ""Car bombings serve no purpose other than to frustrate the peace process, cause death to and injure innocent people. ""We are not going to get to the other elements of the Mitchell report - the confidence-building measures which includes the issue of settlements - until the violence goes down, and that means on both sides. ""The Mitchell report says 'unconditional cessation of violence', and when that occurs, or at least it goes down to some level far below what it is now, then we can begin engaging on all of the confidence-building measures."" Mr Powell said he had not yet had reports from Mr Burns on his meetings with Mr Arafat and the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon. The Israeli transport minister, Ephraim Sneh, said the US should be given about four days to persuade Mr Arafat to stop the violence. If the effort failed, Israeli would ""have no choice"" but to resume military action. The public security minister, Uzi Landau, called for a cancellation of the Israeli ceasefire.

world/2001/jun/11/qanda.terrorism,The execution of Timothy McVeigh,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/11/qanda.terrorism,"What did he do? Timothy McVeigh was convicted in 1997 for the murder of 168 people in 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. He was sentenced to death and died by lethal injection on June 11. In December last year (after losing two appeals) McVeigh said he wanted to die and instructed his lawyers to launch no further appeals against his sentence. His execution originally was set for May 16 but later postponed by nearly a month. Why was it postponed? On May 11, the FBI found 3,000 pages from its investigation into the bombing that it had failed to hand over to defence lawyers. The execution was delayed for 30 days to, in the words of the US attorney general, ""promote and protect the integrity of our system of justice."" What happened next? Over two weeks later, McVeigh's lawyers said they had secured his permission to ask for a judicial review after studying the documents. However, a Denver court turned down the request, saying that the documents represented only a tiny part of the evidence amassed by the FBI. The judge added that there was nothing to cast doubt on the finding that McVeigh detonated the bomb. Why did McVeigh change his mind? McVeigh had confessed to the bombing, and referred to the execution as ""state-assisted suicide"", so it seemed unlikely that he would appeal. Some said he wanted to embarrass the US government and FBI while he still had the chance. Of course, it is also possible that as the execution got closer he simply did not want to die. What do the FBI papers say? Justice department officials said the documents included transcripts of interviews and federal agents' notes taken during the investigation. Most of them, they said, were not directly relevant to the guilty verdict but some recorded witness accounts of a second, unidentified man who was with McVeigh on the day of the bombing. Was he alone? Both McVeigh and federal investigators said he was solely responsible for the bombing. However, McVeigh may be protecting his co-terrorists. On the other side, some suggest that the US federal authorities have tried to suppress evidence of a wider terrorist conspiracy in Oklahoma, and that the conspirators are still at large. McVeigh's former lawyer, Stephen Jones, insists there were between six and eight individuals responsible for the bombing. What was the motive? Two years to the day before the Oklahoma bombing, 75 people died during a botched federal raid on the Davidian cult headquarters at Waco, Texas. In a letter he requested be sent to the Observer, McVeigh said he was ""borrowing a page from US foreign policy"" and had ""decided to send a message to a government that was becoming increasingly hostile by bombing a government building."" He chose the Alfred P Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City. McVeigh was an extremist, opposed to the American federal government in Washington. He was convinced it was plotting to disarm gun owners in preparation for a take over by a shadowy elite of bankers, industrialists and politicians intent on punishing those who disobeyed its new world order. He used a notorious right wing novel - The Turner Diaries - as a blueprint for the attack. It is a hate-filled fantasy about the bombing of a Washington federal building in which 800 people die.

world/2001/may/16/jonhenley,France debates status of Corsica,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/16/jonhenley,"France yesterday took the first step towards granting partial autonomy to Corsica when the national assembly began debating a revolutionary package of laws aimed at ending more than 25 years of separatist violence on the Mediterranean island. The plan, outlined by the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, last summer and since considerably watered down to ensure its acceptance, marks the first time a French government has considered changing Corsica's status since the island became part of France in 1769. It would temporarily transfer the administration of areas such as culture, regional development, education, agriculture, and infrastructure to the Corsican assembly, which after presidential and parliamentary elections in 2002 would have the power to modify certain laws passed in Paris. In a bid to satisfy one of the nationalists' key demands, the plan, which will require a change in the French constitution by 2004 to become permanent, also calls for Corsican language teaching to be offered on the curriculum in primary and junior schools. The Corsican assembly has cautiously welcomed the package, but Gaullists and some republican-minded Socialists fear that other regions, such as Brittany and Alsace, may demand similar treatment. Jean-Pierre Chevènement resigned as interior minister last year over the matter, and the conservative president, Jacques Chirac, has expressed reservations - although his stance seems to be dictated mainly by the electoral advantage that success in Corsica would hand Mr Jospin in next year's presidential race. ""I am very concerned that this territorial fragmentation will spread throughout the country,"" Mr Chevènement said yesterday. ""This bill is a victory for blackmail by a violent minority of Corsicans, and a cowardly abdication of state responsibility. It is a bomb beneath the French Republic."" Mr Chevènement argued that the plan, which is widely expected to be adopted by the national assembly on May 22 before facing the final hurdle of full approval by the constitutional council, would weaken France within the EU. But after a quarter of a century of almost daily violence and mafia-style fraud and corruption, Mr Jospin has said he is willing to take the bet that ""only audacity and a strong dose of decentralisation"" can restore peace to the island. The prime minister's aides say the reform plan has already led to fewer bomb attacks by pro-independence fighters. Surveys show a large majority of Corsicans favour wresting more control of their own affairs from Paris, although only a small number want full independence. Mr Chevènement's successor, Daniel Vaillant, denied that the bill would threaten the unity of the republic or that Corsica risked becoming a ""laboratory for French decentralisation"". In a separate move, the four main radical independence groupings announced at the weekend that they would merge into a single party. Jean-Guy Talamoni, a moderate Corsican nationalist, said this was an ""ominous sign"" and that the bill ""will not guarantee anything, least of all peace"".",2001-05-16T01:41:11Z,"{'polarity': 0.09031557067271356, 'subjectivity': 0.4435279667422525}",0.4435279667422525
world/2001/feb/08/brianwhitaker,Saudis track down drink den owner,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/08/brianwhitaker,"A business associate of the Briton facing execution in Saudi Arabia for a car bomb killing was yesterday moved from his prison cell in Dubai for extradition back to the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Gary Dixon, 55, was involved in running illicit drinking dens with Alexander Mitchell, who at the weekend confessed on Saudi television to causing the explosion which killed another Briton. Mr Mitchell could be beheaded in public if convicted. Mr Dixon, also known as Gary O'Nions and Gary Lyons, established the first commercial-scale drinking den in Riyadh. He fled to Dubai after being arrested in Saudi Arabia last April on suspicion of illegal manufacturing and distribution of alcohol. The Saudis obtained an extradition order after he was held in Dubai. The promised British consular access to Mr Mitchell had not been delivered by early yesterday evening. And in a statement issued through her solicitor yesterday, his sister, Margaret Dunn, 41, said: ""We were shocked at his physical appearance in the televised performance that was supposed to be his confession. He looked drugged or something and nothing like the brother we know and love."" Yesterday, Mr Dixon phoned a friend from his cell in the Dubai CID jail, saying he was about to be moved to Interpol's regional office in Abu Dhabi - from where he would be extradited to Saudi Arabia. Mr Dixon was in jail at the time of the two car bombings last November but yesterday expressed fears that trumped-up charges could be brought against him on his return to Saudi Arabia. Like Mr Mitchell, Mr Dixon was originally employed at the security forces hospital in Riyadh, where he installed the hospital's computer system. Although small-scale illicit drinking has existed among expatriates in Saudi Arabia for years, Mr Dixon was the first to turn it into an industry. His Empire Club was equipped with a gymnasium, restaurant, disco and in-house brewery. It had several hundred members paying subscriptions of 60 riyals (about £10) a month. ""About six years ago there was a major bust,"" a friend of Mr Dixon and Mr Mitchell recalls. ""The club closed for a reasonable time but Gary's sponsor - a high Saudi official - kept him in the kingdom."" It re-opened, only to be raided again about three years ago. Again, the club re-opened. Former members believe the club was able to keep re-opening because Mr Dixon paid a share of the profits to his Saudi sponsor and to a senior police officer in the Sulaymaniyya district of Riyadh. The occasional raids were instigated by the mutawwa (religious police). Despite tough anti-drink laws, the ordinary police were relatively tolerant. A third raid on the Empire Club came just over a year ago. Mr Dixon was out of the country attending a birthday party and his wife, Mary, was arrested. Mr Mitchell stepped in to help. He used his influence with the chief of police and secured her release - though it took about four months. This time the Empire Club stayed closed. Following his arrest last April on alcohol-related charges, Mr Dixon was released on bail. He says he decided to sneak through the desert across the border into the United Arab Emirates, from where he believed the British embassy would help him to return to Britain. Mr Dixon claims that Mr Mitchell, using his knowledge as an ex-soldier, gave him training in desert survival to prepare for the journey. Arriving in the Emirate of Dubai, Mr Dixon says British officials were unwilling to help him. He has spent seven months in jail.",2001-02-08T08:31:49Z,"{'polarity': -0.007668128654970755, 'subjectivity': 0.24735588972431075}",0.24735588972431075

world/2001/may/10/philipwillan,Berlusconi friend on trial for 'aiding Mafia',World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/10/philipwillan,"In the closing days of Italy's general election campaign, the centre-left governing coalition is belatedly targeting a close friend and business associate of the opposition leader, Silvio Berlusconi. Marcello Dell'Utri, a member of the justice commission of the European parliament who is running for the senate in the Milan One constituency, is on trial in Palermo on charges of aiding and abetting the Mafia. Mr Dell'Utri's uncomfortable position - he has been sentenced to two years imprisonment in a separate case for false accounting at Mr Berlusconi's Publitalia advertising company - reflects perhaps the most alarming of the conflicts of interest that have dogged Mr Berlusconi's election campaign: his dispute with the judiciary. Mr Berlusconi has been accused by prosecutors of false accounting and of bribing tax officials and magistrates during his career, and trials are under way. But the most astonishing claim is that he was involved in Mafia bomb attacks in 1992 and 1993. This claim was rejected last month by magistrates in Caltanissetta, who spent almost two years examining allegations that Mr Berlusconi was connected to the bomb blasts that killed two anti-Mafia magistrates, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, in 1992. The investigation originated in allegations made by Mafia supergrasses about contacts between Mr Berlusconi and Mr Dell'Utri and the Mafia ""boss of bosses"", Toto Riina. The alleged contacts, according to a ""pentito"", Salvatore Cancemi, were to lead to legislation favourable to Cosa Nostra, and protection from the consequences of Falcone's murder. The underlying premise was that Cosa Nostra would support Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in return for political favours. There is no evidence in support of the allegations and Mr Berlusconi and his supporters say such accusations are ridiculous, an example of leftwing magistrates colluding with unreliable witnesses to eliminate political opponents. Mr Dell'Utri's trial concerns his contact with Vittorio Mangano who was hired by the media magnate to look after horses at his Arcore estate near Milan in the early 1970s. It later emerged that Mangano was a Mafioso. The prosecution in Palermo alleges that Mr Dell'Utri knew that Mangano, now dead, was linked to the Mafia and chose him for that reason: Mr Berlusconi was worried about his family being kidnapped. ""Mr Dell'Utri turned to the Mafia for protection,"" Antonio Ingroia, the prosecutor, said. ""If you ask the Mafia for a favour, you are liable to get definitively caught in a relationship of mutual assistance."" Mangano was later convicted of Mafia association and drug trafficking. Mr Dell'Utri has denied that he was aware of Mangano's Mafia links at the time, but he admitted to investigators that when Mangano introduced him to friends, he rarely mentioned names. ""Names are never mentioned when you introduce people in Mangano's world,"" he told magistrates. Mr Dell'Utri has admitted that he continued to see Mangano, even after the latter left Arcore under a cloud. He told magistrates he was ""afraid"" of him and did not dare to rebuff him. In an interview in 1996, however, he said he saw nothing odd about his contact, saying: ""I would accept his company even today.""",2001-05-10T01:23:40Z,"{'polarity': -0.03103448275862069, 'subjectivity': 0.3850574712643678}",0.3850574712643678

world/2001/apr/14/paulwebster,Mustard gas leak town evacuated,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/14/paulwebster,"About 15,000 people living around the British first world war battlefield of Vimy in Flanders were forced to leave their homes yesterday after a huge dump of Great War ammunition started leaking waves of deadly mustard gas. British tourists visiting cemeteries and battlegrounds in the Pas de Calais were among families told to stay out of the area where 173 tonnes of recently uncovered explosive weapons, including 16,000 shells and bombs, were stored in the open waiting to be destroyed. The evacuation of Vimy, with a population of 4,700, and the villages of Farbuf, Willerval, Acheville and Arleux-en-Gohelle, came only a day after 10,000 people were ferried out of the centre of Lorient following the discovery of a 500lb second world war British bomb. The boobytrapped missile was safely defused. But the alert in the Atlantic port bore no comparison to the emergency around the Vimy dump where army engineers stock much of the 500 tonnes of rusting first and second world war ammunition recovered every year in France. The holding area on farmland is unguarded and protected only by a barbed wire fence. Local people have repeatedly expressed concern over the dangers and the frequent thefts by souvenir hunters. Yesterday, about 3,500 firemen, police and soldiers, including 50 bomb disposal experts, were drafted into the area, which 500,000 people visit each year. The emergency evacuation, in which 130 buses were sent from Lille, appears to have been precipitated by the extremely heavy rain in northern France which has caused widespread flooding in the Somme and Pas de Calais where hundreds of families have had to be rescued from flooded homes. Several people, including farmers, said they would not obey a 6pm deadline to quit Vimy after security forces went from door to door to tell them of the danger. There was a flurry of panic when parents were told to take their children out of school and seek safety. ""Everybody was running this way and that,"" a nursery school worker said. ""People are leaving with their TVs and stereos because they are afraid of looting."" While evacuees were found emergency lodging in hotels, hospitals, holiday centres and schools, the army moved in with refrigerated lorries to take the unstable ammunition to an army depot in the Marne where it will be destroyed in an operation that could take up to 10 days.

world/2001/may/23/israel,Israel admits F-16 attack was flawed,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/23/israel,"A senior Israeli general admitted yesterday that the bombing of a Palestinian security compound by F-16 fighter jets in which nine police officers died - the first use of warplanes against Palestinians inside the occupied territories since 1967 - was not ""a complete success"". Major-General Giora Eiland, head of strategic planning for the Israeli army, acknowledged for the first time that the use of F-16s - widely denounced as an excessive use of force - had been less than successful. He said the bombing runs in Nablus last Friday, which followed a Palestinian suicide bomb attack in Netanya in which five people died, had been designed to kill Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, a leading member of the Islamic militant group Hamas. He is suspected of organising several suicide bombs and was in a building in which he was allegedly being protected by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Gen Eiland said: ""We decided to target that building, hoping to kill him. He was only lightly wounded and in this sense the operation was not a complete success."" He added: ""Sometimes our attacks are not effective. I'm not saying we always know what to do and how to do it."" Asked to comment on Gen Eiland's statement about Abu Hanoud, the Palestinian information minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo, said this was a ""lie"". The attacks on Nablus and Ramallah have drawn the US back into the peace process, and prompted the Israeli press to accuse Ariel Sharon's government of escalating the crisis. Reuven Pedatzur, an Israeli expert on missile defence, wrote in yesterday's Ha'aretz newspaper that the decision to use warplanes was ""blatant evidence that something is very wrong in the supreme command [of the Israeli army]"". He added: ""The judgment of those who decided to use F-16 fighter planes to try and hunt down one individual _ should scare the living daylights out of every Israeli citizen."" However, Gen Eiland defended the mission. ""The F-16 is a heavy weapon and it has the image of excessive use of force. But the reality is [that] it is an accurate weapon, and we made an accurate attack on a legitimate military target."" Speaking in London a day after the publication of the ex-US senator George Mitchell's report into the eight-month intifada, which calls on both sides to end the violence, Gen Eiland gave a bleak assessment of prospects for peace. He said the fighting would only stop if Mr Arafat ordered an end to the uprising. If not, it could continue for years. Israeli military tactics were geared towards wearing out his regime and driving a wedge between Mr Arafat and his people. ""When we bomb a target we are trying to show the Palestinian leadership that there are costs on both sides. In the long run, this will create problems for the Palestinian regime and that will help persuade them to stop the violence."" Since the uprising began last September, Gen Eiland said that 88 Israelis had been killed, 55 of them civilians. ""It is no doubt that it is the policy of Palestinian leaders that every Israeli is a legitimate target."" In the same period, at least 444 Palestinians have been killed. Gen Eiland said Israeli intelligence had identified 62% of those as members of Hamas, Islamic Jihad or Mr Arafat's elite bodyguard, Force 17. ""We cannot prove anything about the rest, but we believe the vast majority are people who fight against us."" The claim that a high proportion of Palestinian victims were aligned to groups dedi cated to violence was disputed.

world/2001/mar/17/israel,Israeli 'relaxation' fails to soften Palestinian day of rage,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/17/israel,"A Palestinian man was shot dead by Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip and at least 12 others were wounded as clashes erupted throughout the Palestinian territories yesterday. The man was named as Mohammed Abu Awn, 20, and said to have been shot in the chest while sitting near protesters hurling stones at troops guarding the road to the Jewish settlement of Netzarim. In the West Bank troops fired rubber bullets and teargas at hundreds of Palestinians throwing stones in protest at the Israeli encirclement of Ramallah. In Gaza city young children enacted a suicide bombing: a boy of 10 went on stage in a white shroud and climbed into a coffin-like box covered with an Israeli flag as another boy threw a firecracker to mimic the sound of an explosion. Palestinian groups had called a ""day of rage"" to maintain pressure on Israel to relax the restrictions imposed on the Palestinian people since the intifada began in September. Israel says it has begun to relax the clampdown, but Palestinian leaders say the changes are inadequate. The defence ministry said it would open both the Allenby bridge between the West Bank and Jordan and the Gaza-Egypt border during daylight hourts, and ease restrictions at Karni to allow raw materials in and out of the West Bank. A statement said the minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, ""expects that these steps will encourage the Palestinian economy and says that every drop in the level of violence will enable Israel to provide greater easings to the Palestinian population"". Late on Thursday Israel said it had arrested three members of the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's guard on suspicion of trying to explode a bomb near the West Bank military headquarters. Military sources said the three-man cell was involved in attacks in which eight Israelis were killed and 20 wounded. They include the December 31 ambush in the West Bank which killed the son and daughter-in-law of the late Meir Kahane, the rightwing extremist rabbi. The Israeli authorities have justified the closure of Ramallah as an attempt to foil attacks by the cell, said to be headed by the Ramallah commander of Force 17, an elite Palestinian security unit. The news of the arrests, and the suspects' close connection to the Palestinian Authority, was expected to back up the prime minister Ariel Sharon's decision not to renew peace talks with the Palestinians immediately. Meanwhile the spiritual leader of the militant Hamas group, Sheikh Yassin, has threatened to carry out big attacks on Israel. He predicted ""better, bigger and greater"" bomb attacks in the coming days. In recent months Hamas has stepped up its campaign against Israel and has been responsible for numerous attacks, including a recent bomb in a taxi and the Netanya bombing, which killed three Israelis. In the Palestinian-controlled city of Nablus, in the north of the West Bank, 2,500 people held a peaceful protest ""Lift the closure. Sharon lift the closure, this is the last time,"" they shouted. They said they planned more demonstrations on Saturday, and would march on the Israeli checkpoints on the outskirts of the city: an action likely to cause clashes with the Israeli soldiers posted there to enforce the closure. Brigadier-General Benny Gantz, the commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank, said in an interview published yesterday that the uprising was not conducted by ordinary people but organised from above. He told the newspaper Ma'ariv that he did not believe Yasser Arafat had made a major effort to halt the violence, in which at least 346 Palestinians, 13 Israeli Arabs and 65 other Israelis have been killed. The Palestinians want the UN to send an observer force to help quell the violence in the West Bank and Gaza. All the security council members support the call, except the US, but some western ambassadors say their support is conditional on Israel's approval.",2001-03-17T01:25:09Z,"{'polarity': 0.014445970695970697, 'subjectivity': 0.3306318681318682}",0.3306318681318682
world/2001/mar/30/julianborger,McVeigh brushes aside deaths,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/30/julianborger,"The 19 children killed in the bombing of an Oklahoma City government building six years ago were ""collateral damage"", Timothy McVeigh, the worst home-grown terrorist in US history told the the authors of a new book about the attack. McVeigh, 32, who is due to be executed by lethal injection on May 16, said his only regret was not to have levelled the entire building, in which 168 people died, and expressed pride in having carried out the bombing on his own. Lou Michel and Dan Herbeck, two US journalists who interviewed him extensively in prison, said yesterday that McVeigh had claimed not to have known that there was a child-care centre in the Alfred P Murrah building before he parked a lorry full of explosives on the road outside and walked away on April 19 1995. ""I recognised that someone might be bringing their kid to work,"" they quoted him as saying. ""However, if I had known there was a day-care centre, it might have given me pause to switch targets. That's a large amount of collateral damage."" But an FBI investigator Danny Defenbaugh said that McVeigh must have seen the brightly coloured children's pictures in the windows. In any case, it does not appear to have caused McVeigh much remorse. His main concern appeared to be that the child deaths dampened the galvanising effect he had hoped the bomb attack would have on the US far-right. ""I understand what they felt in Oklahoma City,"" he said. But ""I have no sympathy for them."" This picture of an unrepentant killer emerges from American Terrorist: Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City Bombing, due to be published next month. Michel told ABC News that McVeigh said that a friend from his army days, Terry Nichols, had helped him to build the bomb, but that the attack was his own idea. ""You can't handle the truth,"" McVeigh said, quoting a character played by Jack Nicholson in the film A Few Good Men. ""Because the truth is I blew up the Murrah building and isn't it kind of scary that one man could reap this kind of hell?"" McVeigh said the attack was in revenge for the killing of the wife and child of a white separatist in a gun battle with the FBI at Ruby Ridge in Idaho in 1992, and the FBI raid on the Branch Davidian religious cult in Waco, Texas, in 1993. The bombing occurred on the second anniversary of the Waco raid.",2001-03-30T00:57:53Z,"{'polarity': 0.10451215451215454, 'subjectivity': 0.4721070596070596}",0.4721070596070596
world/2001/may/25/israel2,Toll rises in wedding tragedy,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/25/israel2,"At least 25 people were reported killed and hundreds injured when a three-storey wedding hall in west Jerusalem collapsed late last night. Guests were left clinging to the side of the building for 15 minutes waiting for rescuers to arrive. Scores of people remain trapped and police said it could take three days to recover all the bodies Witnesses said around 700 people were attending the event on the top floor of the Versailles wedding hall when the floor collapsed and crashed through two empty storeys below. It left a gaping hole through the centre of the structure while its frontage remained eerily intact, its name still illuminated in large, blue letters. The Jerusalem police commander Miki Levy said the col lapse was due to a ""structural failure"" and was ""absolutely not"" a bomb. ""To the best of my understanding, there is some sort of engineering, technical connection in the building. The ceiling simply fell down."" He added that 247 people had been taken to hospital so far but there were signs of life from people trapped under the rubble. A special Israeli army rescue unit was at the scene. Witnesses described scenes of horror as friends and relatives were flung into the hole. Others clung to the outer edges of the damaged building and had to inch their way to safety. A guest, Yovel Sarur, said: ""We were dancing when we felt the floor tremble. We stopped for a minute but we kept on dancing and then before we knew what was happening we were falling. We kept going down, down, one floor after another."" Mr Sarur, whose head was bandaged, said he had no idea what had happened to his wife and daughter even several hours later. A man who identified himself as a childhood friend of the groom said: ""We grabbed hold of tablecloths and tied them together to lower ourselves to the floor."" He said the groom was only slightly hurt but the bride was seriously ill with chest injuries. A spokesman for the Bikur Holim hospital confirmed that the bride had been injured. One of the rescue workers , Haggai Lavie, 25, said he had seen at least three bodies removed from the wreckage, and scores more were trapped beneath huge concrete slabs. Rescuers used their bare hands to clear therubble and trees on the pavement outside were cut down to move in heavy lifting equipment. Efraim Meiran, a relative of the groom, said: ""It was like an atom bomb. A hole opened up and people fell through; tables of people - one 20 centimetres from us -and the entire band disappeared."" Sara Pinhas, another of the groom's relatives, said that the dancers had just lifted the father of the bride on a chair when suddenly he fell, ""and then we felt the whole building collapse"". Efraim Rino, a guest, said: ""People were flying through the air, the orchestra, the loudspeakers, everything fell."" ""There was no blast. The floor opened up under me. I saw my brothers fall inside and I fell on top of them,"" said another, Yochi Bar-Zani. Another man described how he fell holding the hand of his 10-year-old son. He said both were rescued from beneath the rubble. He said his son had told him: ""'Daddy, don't be frightened. I'm with you'. Then we fell through one floor and another."" Rescue workers arrived in minutes and victims who had been pulled from the rubble were lined up on stretchers awaiting ambulances to take them to hospitals. Many were unconscious and bleeding. Relatives gathered in front of Jerusalem hospitals, desperately seeking news. Others said they had helped pull people out of the wreckage of the building before they were taken to the hospitals themselves. Doctors said many children had been injured, including a three-month-old baby. The mayor of Jerusalem Ehud Olmert said, ""This is a terrible, terrible tragedy."" The owners of the 15-year-old building said there had been plaster work on the first floor recently but that had not involved any support beams. Meanwhile, the public security minister, Uzi Landau, said a committee of experts would be formed to investigate the causes of the collapse.

world/2001/may/23/israel3,Israel admits F-16 attack was flawed,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/23/israel3,"A senior Israeli general admitted yesterday that the bombing of a Palestinian security compound by F-16 fighter jets in which nine police officers died - the first use of warplanes against Palestinians inside the occupied territories since 1967 - was not ""a complete success"". Major-General Giora Eiland, head of strategic planning for the Israeli army, acknowledged for the first time that the use of F-16s - widely denounced as an excessive use of force - had been less than successful. He said the bombing runs in Nablus last Friday, which followed a Palestinian suicide bomb attack in Netanya in which five people died, had been designed to kill Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, a leading member of the Islamic militant group Hamas. He is suspected of organising several suicide bombs and was in a building in which he was allegedly being protected by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Gen Eiland said: ""We decided to target that building, hoping to kill him. He was only lightly wounded and in this sense the operation was not a complete success."" He added: ""Sometimes our attacks are not effective. I'm not saying we always know what to do and how to do it."" Asked to comment on Gen Eiland's statement about Abu Hanoud, the Palestinian information minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo, said this was a ""lie"". The attacks on Nablus and Ramallah have drawn the US back into the peace process, and prompted the Israeli press to accuse Ariel Sharon's government of escalating the crisis. Reuven Pedatzur, an Israeli expert on missile defence, wrote in yesterday's Ha'aretz newspaper that the decision to use warplanes was ""blatant evidence that something is very wrong in the supreme command [of the Israeli army]"". He added: ""The judgment of those who decided to use F-16 fighter planes to try and hunt down one individual _ should scare the living daylights out of every Israeli citizen."" However, Gen Eiland defended the mission. ""The F-16 is a heavy weapon and it has the image of excessive use of force. But the reality is [that] it is an accurate weapon, and we made an accurate attack on a legitimate military target."" Speaking in London a day after the publication of the ex-US senator George Mitchell's report into the eight-month intifada, which calls on both sides to end the violence, Gen Eiland gave a bleak assessment of prospects for peace. He said the fighting would only stop if Mr Arafat ordered an end to the uprising. If not, it could continue for years. Israeli military tactics were geared towards wearing out his regime and driving a wedge between Mr Arafat and his people. ""When we bomb a target we are trying to show the Palestinian leadership that there are costs on both sides. In the long run, this will create problems for the Palestinian regime and that will help persuade them to stop the violence."" Since the uprising began last September, Gen Eiland said that 88 Israelis had been killed, 55 of them civilians. ""It is no doubt that it is the policy of Palestinian leaders that every Israeli is a legitimate target."" In the same period, at least 444 Palestinians have been killed. Gen Eiland said Israeli intelligence had identified 62% of those as members of Hamas, Islamic Jihad or Mr Arafat's elite bodyguard, Force 17. ""We cannot prove anything about the rest, but we believe the vast majority are people who fight against us."" The claim that a high proportion of Palestinian victims were aligned to groups dedi cated to violence was disputed. The Israeli human rights group B'tselem said 106 of the Palestinian dead were aged under 18, suggesting they were unlikely to be members of any organisation. Asked about the deaths of civilians, Gen Eiland said they got caught in crossfire because terrorists operated among the Palestinian people. ""Of course we regret it when a baby gets killed.

Valery Radchikov, who was facing a new investigation into the murder of 14 mourners at a funeral after having been cleared of the crimes, died when his car crashed into a lorry outside Moscow. A colonel in Russian military intelligence who lost both legs in the Afghan war, Radchikov became head of the 14,000-strong Afghan Invalids Foundation in 1991 but lost the post in 1993 amid claims that he had swindled tens of millions of pounds from the charity. His rival and replacement, Mikhail Likhodei, was murdered by a bomb in 1996. At his funeral, a bomb exploded killing 14 mourners including Likhodei's widow. Radchikov spent three years on remand after being charged with the murders. He was acquitted last January, before the supreme court ordered in August that the case be reopened. In the early 1990s President Boris Yeltsin awarded some Russian charities tax-exempt importing perks. In the case of the Afghan Vets, as generally, the proceeds and the profits did not go to the invalids. Audits of Radchikov's business in the 1990s showed that some £140m were unaccounted for. Radchikov had announced only on Monday that he intended taking his case to the European court of human rights.

The Iraqi News Agency said the planes attacked Tall Afar, 440km northwest of Baghdad, the capital. It did not say when, but it said the victims were buried earlier today. ""America and its ally, Britain, have committed a new, ugly crime that will be added to the record of their heinous crimes against Iraq,"" the agency said. ""The people of Tall Afar buried today the martyrs amid shouts of anger and condemnation against this crime."" A spokesman for US forces at the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey, from where flights over northern Iraq take off, denied anything was bombed. ""We flew today, but we did not ... drop anything,"" said Major Scott Vadnais. On Tuesday, the news agency had quoted an unidentified Iraqi military spokesman as saying allied forces had tried to bomb a civil installation in the north but had been chased off by Iraqi air defences. Iraq had claimed hitting a plane, but US officials denied any planes were hit during a mission over northern Iraq on Tuesday. Major Ed Loomis, public affairs officer for the US European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, denied such a hit could have happened on Tuesday.

""Our aircraft completed their mission without dropping any ordnance and returned safely to their bases ... The Iraqi allegations are absolutely false.""

world/2001/feb/19/iraq.usa,Leader: Iraq raid sheds worrying light on Mr Bush,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/19/iraq.usa,"The escalation of US military pressure on Iraq is in many ways more worrying for Britain than it is for Saddam Hussein. Every bomb that falls strengthens the Iraqi dictator's claim to pan-Arab leadership in defiance of a supposedly hostile western imperialism. Every long-range cruise or ""stand-off"" air-launched missile merely emphasises Washington's fear of sustaining casualties or losing hostages in an unwinnable war fought at a safe distance. Saddam knows very well that a large-scale land invasion of Iraq by allied ground troops like that begun and halted in 1991, the only sure way to unseat him, is no longer feasible. How amusing he must find current US talk of funding and infiltrating Iraqi opposition groups more accustomed to sipping coffee in well-appointed London apartments. Every raid increases the discomfort of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, squirmingly reluctant hosts to the allied planes. Far from reminding Saddam of his enemies' power and resolve, every sortie reminds a watching world of America's bankrupt policy of bombs and sanctions. All of which is deeply worrying for Britain given its uniquely close association with this US policy which many European allies, as well as Russia and China, fiercely oppose. Tony Blair says he acted to defend RAF pilots against an increased threat in the no-fly zones. But, legally speaking, their presence there has no specific UN or other authorisation. Robin Cook says Britain has a humanitarian mission to protect the southern Shia and the Kurds against Saddam's depredations. But this justification relates to the situation 10 years ago. Saddam suppressed the Shia long ago; and the biggest threat to the Kurds is the Turks (and other Kurds). The government has a duty to protect our armed forces. But it has an equal duty not to put them in harm's way unnecessarily. Paradoxically, Britain recently warned the US that the no-fly zone patrols were becoming unacceptably hazardous, even pointless. But instead of taking the rational course and ending them, George Bush decided to use new, secretly agreed rules of engagement to expand them. The resulting, highly escalatory attacks on targets near Baghdad cannot be supported as a matter of law or common sense. They do absolutely nothing to help end Saddam's undoubtedly dangerous tyranny. They diminish the chances that imminent UN talks with Iraq on a resumption of weapons inspections will succeed. They will do nothing to curb the rampant oil smuggling upon which Saddam is once again growing strong. They undermine the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, who may have hoped to rally support for less indiscriminately punitive, arms-focused sanctions during his Middle East visit this week. They increase tension and instability in a region already reeling from the Palestinian intifada and Ariel Sharon's triumph in Israel. Oddly, the attacks did not target chemical and biological weapons facilities that the US says Saddam is rebuilding. Since the proliferation of such mass terror weapons is America's principal stated security concern, why were these alleged factories not bombed? That at least would have been understandable. Worrying for Britain, too, is what this irresponsible action says about the insecure, aggressive mindset of the new administration in Washington. In a sense Mr Bush was testing Mr Blair's loyalty, sucking him back into a conflict he has no mandate to fight. When the two men meet for the first time later this week, the president is likely to want more oaths of fealty, seeking British acquiescence in his globally destabilising missile defence plans, for example, in his intention to disengage in the Balkans and in his apparent belief that Nato has a right of veto over the EU's military aspirations. Increasingly, this domineering American security agenda does not serve Britain's interests, nor that of Britain's European partners. This latest episode in Iraq starkly demonstrates that. Seeking to be special friends with Mr Bush is all very well. But not at any price, Mr Blair. This American president is dangerous.

world/2001/apr/24/israel,Opposition towards Israel increases,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/24/israel,"Israel is facing punitive measures from the EU because of hardening and widening opposition to its policies towards the Palestinians, diplomats said last night. Violence continued yesterday with a Palestinian boy killed at a funeral in Gaza and four injured in a car bomb explosion in Israel. EU member states, including Britain, are now actively debating changing their approach to the Jewish state, with decisions expected at two key foreign ministers' meetings next month. France is leading a campaign to suspend Israel's prized association agreement with the EU, which gives it preferential trade terms worth millions of dollars. A more likely result will be a crackdown on Israel's flouting of EU ""rules of origin"" under which goods produced in occupied territories have been illegally benefiting from duty free access. The EU is also likely to cold -shoulder Israeli attempts to secure enhanced cooperation in science and technology. In the latest in a series of signals that it cannot be business as usual with the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, Brussels last week issued an angry condemnation of Israeli attacks on both Syria and Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has insisted that the statement was one-sided, and warned that the EU is in danger of losing what little influence it has. Romano Prodi, the president of the European commission, and Chris Patten, external relations commissioner, are being targeted by Israel to persuade them to adopt a softer line. In the past Israel has been defended in the EU by traditional friends such as the Netherlands, Sweden and Britain, but it now has few defenders left, even in Germany, where public opinion wants to see action. The Belgian foreign minister, Louis Michel, yesterday met the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, in the West Bank town, Ramallah. Mr Michel, whose government is next in line for the European presidency, angered the Israeli government two months ago by threatening EU sanctions. In a significant development, Mr Arafat said afterwards: ""I want to be very clear. We are against any operation targeting civilians, whether they are Israelis or Palestinians."" Israeli army radio said it had been the first condemnation by the Palestinian leader since the uprising began in September. The Israeli government also took a tentative step towards renewing the peace process, but there was little optimism on either side. Mr Sharon's government yesterday said it was still considering a Jordanian-Egyptian peace plan under which Israel would lift its economic embargo of the West Bank and Gaza in return for the Palestinians ending their attacks on Israel and Jewish settlements. The 12-year-old Palestinian killed yesterday, Muhanad Muhareb, died at a funeral near the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. The funeral was of a Palestinian security man killed in fighting with the Israelis last week. Palestinian witnesses said that as the body was being lowered to the ground, Palestinian gunmen fired a 21-gun salute, prompting fire either from an Israeli army outpost or the Jewish settlement it was guarding. Fourteen other Palestinians were wounded. An Israel army spokesman said: ""We had very heavy fire from the Palestinian side. There were exchanges of fire and we were forced to protect ourselves."" Eyad Saadoni, a maths teacher, said mourners scattered in panic, seeking shelter in abandoned buildings. ""I ran away about 100 metres,"" he said. ""Then I sat near a wall, where some people were trying to take cover. Some of them were kneeling next to the grave. Others covered their heads with their hands.

world/2001/feb/04/lockerbie.uk,Libyans' outcry as trial doubts grow,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/04/lockerbie.uk,"Three young men slashed their throats with razors during demonstrations in Tripoli yesterday as doubts grew in Scotland over the safety of the conviction of a Libyan agent for the Lockerbie bombing, As thousands of Libyans took to the streets of their capital to protest against the life sentence passed last Wednesday on Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, a legal expert involved in the trial said the conviction was profoundly worrying. 'The judgment is so weak that I do not believe that it justifies Megrahi's conviction beyond reasonable doubt,' said Professor Robert Black of Edinburgh University, who played a key role in shaping the trial format to break the eight-year deadlock over Libya's refusal to hand over the two suspects. In Tripoli, the protesters who cut their throats collapsed to the ground with blood spurting from their necks, and were taken to hos pital. They did it 'to show the world that Libyan blood is cheap to defend the country and the people's dignity,' said fellow demonstrator Ali al-Arif, 63. The injured men's condition was not being made public last night. At the specially-constructed Scottish court in the Netherlands last week, Megrahi was unanimously found guilty by three senior judges of the murder of the 270 people killed when a bomb tore through Pan Am Flight 103 on 21 December, 1988, showering the Scottish town with burning debris. His co-accused, Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, was acquitted. In their 82-page written explanation of the verdicts, Lords Sutherland, Coulsfield and MacLean agreed with the prosecution that Megrahi, 48, had placed an unaccompanied suitcase containing the bomb - concealed in a cassette recorder - on a flight from Malta to Frankfurt. It was transferred to a feeder flight to Heathrow, where it was placed on Flight 103 bound for New York. All 259 passengers and crew and 11 residents of Lockerbie were killed when the bomb exploded on the jumbo-jet 38 minutes into the flight. Megrahi was sentenced to a minimum of 20 years imprisonment, to be served in Scotland. His legal team were still refusing to comment publicly on the verdicts this weekend, but an appeal is believed to be inevitable. After the verdict on Wednesday, Megrahi's counsel, William Taylor QC, told the judges he would offer no mitigation to the court as his client continued to protest his innocence. Notice of any intention to appeal must be received by the court within 14 days of the verdict. Under Scots law, there is no automatic right to appeal, and a hearing seeking leave to do so must take place within six weeks. If leave is granted, the appeal will be heard by a panel of five senior judges at Camp Zeist, the court and prison complex near the Dutch city of Utrecht, in which Megrahi continues to be held. Until now, the chances of a successful appeal, which must be on a point of law or on new evidence, have been regarded as slim. Most successful challenges to criminal convictions are based on a misdirection of the jury by the trial, but the unprecedented Lockerbie trial had no jury as it took place before a panel of three judges. After 12 years, the emergence of new evidence is also deemed unlikely. Libya and other Arab countries are demanding that sanctions against Tripoli be lifted following the end of the trial, but the United States and Britain insist that the isolated North African state has not yet earned a full pardon. The demonstrators yesterday repeated demands for the immediate lifting of the sanctions. There were also the first signs of a backlash against the Libyan leader and his regime's handling of the case. With internal pressure building up, he will make a speech tomorrow in which he claims he will reveal evidence that proves Megrahi's innocence. stuart.millar@observer.co.uk",2001-02-04T02:44:11Z,"{'polarity': 0.07328302328302327, 'subjectivity': 0.4297121797121798}",0.4297121797121798

Six people have been arrested following the disturbance and further arrests are planned, they said. Last night's violent eruption in the Harehill area of Leeds ended up two police officers injured, 25 cars burnt out and a shop set alight. West Yorkshire assistant chief constable Grahame Maxwell said: ""The events were criminal activity, pure and simple. ""We were called to the Banstead Park area at about 8.15pm last night by reports of a petrol bomb being thrown. ""Police attended but there was no trace of any incident. However, this appears to have been the start of a premeditated attack on police officers, who were drawn into the area."" Officers will spend today studying video evidence and investigating what sparked off the violence. Assistant chief constable Steve Smith said there was no evidence to suggest racist groups were involved in the disorder. He said the troublemakers had mostly been Asian, although Afro Caribbean and white youths had joined in. Some sources said the trouble followed the arrest of a local man two days ago. One onlooker said last night: ""Tonight is a reaction to the lack of police action following the incident in which a man was sprayed in the face with CS gas."" The unnamed man said police were supposed to have a meeting yesterday with the Bangladeshi community but nothing had happened. He added: ""They took this man, they arrested him, kicked him and sprayed CS gas at him in front of Asian people. And that's why it started tonight. It is not a racist attack, this is because of police inaction.""

world/2001/mar/07/israel1,Sharon induction threatened by new violence,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/07/israel1,"Ariel Sharon will be sworn in today as Israel's prime minister, supported by a broad based coalition government designed to end years of political instability, but threatened with a new wave of suicide bombings from Palestinian militants. Mr Sharon's accession to the prime minister's post was pending approval in the parliament of his national unity government, but that was generally expected to be a formality. Mr Sharon already fulfilled his first campaign promise by stitching together a coalition from centre left to far right, with the support of a solid majority among legislators. The coalition will allow Israelis ""to stand together, facing what at this moment poses the greatest danger - the deteriorating state of security,"" Mr Sharon told his Likud party this morning. He said he would also seek to achieve peace with the Palestinians, but repeated his position that negotiations would begin ""only after quiet will reign."" The unwieldy coalition government includes Nobel peace prize laureate Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, who will sit at the same cabinet table with the hawkish Rehavam Zeevi, the tourism minister, whose party advocates removing Palestinians from the West Bank. Attracting the Labour party of defeated prime minister, Ehud Barak, then enlisting faction after faction in the fractious Knesset, the 73-year old Mr Sharon hopes to remain in power where others have fallen, serving out his term until mid-2003. Mr Sharon is Israel's fifth prime minister in less than six years. Only gross mismanagement or extremist actions can topple him, said analyst Hanan Crystal. ""The Labour party can't bring down the government,"" he said. Mr Sharon's Likud party has only 19 seats in the 120-member Knesset, second in size to Labour's 23, but he hopes to hold together a coalition of just over 70 seats. Mr Sharon will have no grace period. The militant Islamic group Hamas threatened to greet the new prime minister, considered an archenemy by the Palestinians, with a series of suicide bombings. A Hamas statement in Beirut, Lebanon, yesterday said the first of those attacks was carried out on Sunday, when a Palestinian set off a bomb in the coastal city of Netanya, killing himself and three Israelis. The statement said the group's military wing was responsible, identifying the bomber as Ahmed Alyan, 23, from a West Bank refugee camp. Last night a small explosion went off in Jerusalem inside a garbage truck when workers tossed garbage into the vehicle, police said. The incident damaged the truck, but did not cause any injuries.

world/2001/jun/16/russia.usa1,Sparring begins in Ljubljana,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/16/russia.usa1,"With Moscow declaring that its nuclear sword is mightier than any missile shield the Americans care to build, Presidents Vladimir Putin and George Bush meet face to face for the first time today to map out a new relationship. The summit in the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana, is due to last two hours, the home straight of Mr Bush's race to persuade sceptical European allies and hostile Russians of the need for ambitious missile defences to replace the security measures of the cold war. Mr Putin arrives in Ljubljana from China, bolstered by Beijing's opposition to the ""Son of Star Wars"" project, while Mr Bush flies in from Warsaw, the key new Nato member in central Europe. But despite the hostile rhetoric, each side is keen to get the other's measure. Mr Bush repeatedly stressed in Warsaw yesterday that he wanted Mr Putin to be a ""partner"" and a ""friend"". He said: ""I'll express my hopes for a Russia that is truly great."" No deals are to be signed and no breakthroughs are expected. The Bush team is bent on scrapping the structures which governed the relationship under Bill Clinton. It also opposes Russian proposals to establish joint working groups on missile defence and nuclear arms cuts. There is much US anger at Russia's cooperation with Iran. Mr Bush said yesterday that he was worried about the danger of nuclear proliferation on Russia's ""southern borders"", after the Washington Post reported that Russia had supplied Tehran with material needed to make a nuclear bomb. The Americans are expected to offer Russia economic sweeteners, and to propose buying Russian anti-missile and anti-aircraft systems for the proposed missile shield, to weaken Moscow's opposition to the plan.

world/2001/apr/25/uk.comment,Comment: nuclear weapons back on agenda,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/25/uk.comment,"It is time we Europeans woke up to the fact, however uncomfortable it may be, that nuclear weapons are well and truly back on the agenda. A growing lobby of American political and military zealots, reawakened by President Bush's election success and egged on by leading scientists, want to attack ""rogue"" states with nuclear weapons. Under proposals being considered by the US defence department, ""mini-nukes"" would attack dictators' underground headquarters and their supplies of chemical and biological weapons. Nukes would do what conventional bombs have conspicuously failed to achieve: knock out bunkers being built deeper and deeper into the rocks. User-friendly, ""low-yield"", nuclear weapons would limit collateral damage (ie killing civilians) and radioactive fall-out, argue their proponents. ""The US will undoubtedly require a new nuclear weapon... because it is realised that the yields of the weapons left over from the cold war are too high for addressing the deterrence requirements of a multipolar, widely proliferated world,"" Paul Robinson, director of America's Sandia Nuclear Laboratories pronounced recently. ""Low-yield weapons with highly accurate delivery systems"" would be a useful deterrent, he said, adding that such devices could help decision-makers ""contemplate the destruction of some buried or hidden targets while being mindful of the need to minimise collateral damage"". In a paper entitled Nuclear Weapons in the 21st Century, Stephen Younger, head of nuclear weapons research at the Los Alamos laboratory, last year said low-yield nukes would be more effective against underground concrete bunkers and mobile missiles than conventional bombs. Weapons of less than five kilotons, the argument goes, would be a more credible deterrent than ""normal"" nuclear weapons. Indeed, they could have been used during the Kosovo war. And mini-nukes would enable the US to reduce its stockpile of 6,000 much larger nuclear warheads. The taboo, whereby nuclear weapons would not be used against non-nuclear powers as a war-fighting tool, was breached last year in an amendment to the US defence budget authorisation bill tabled by two republican senators, John Warner and Wayne Allard. This required the Pentagon to study how best to bomb buried targets, including the use of low-yield nuclear devices. A 1994 law, the Federation of American Scientists points out in a recent report, prohibits nuclear laboratories in the US from undertaking research and development that could lead to a precision nuclear weapon of less than five kilotons because ""low-yield nuclear weapons blur the distinction between nuclear and conventional war"". However, it warns that legislation for long-term research and actual development of low-yield nuclear weapons will almost certainly be proposed in the new session of Congress. The notion that an accurate, low-yield, nuclear bomb would cause limited - acceptable - collateral damage is ludicrous. As Martin Butcher and Theresa Hitchens, two security analysts, point out, a five-kiloton warhead dropped on London might only destroy Islington. But it would kill thousands of people and make thousands more victims of burns, radiation sickness, and blindness. ""The use of any nuclear weapon capable of destroying a buried target that is otherwise immune to conventional attack will necessarily produce enormous numbers of civilian casualties,"" the federation points out in its report. ""No earth-burrowing missile can penetrate deep enough into the earth to contain an explosion with a nuclear yield even as small as 1% of the 15 kiloton Hiroshima weapon,"" it says. ""The explosion simply blows out a massive crater of radioactive dirt, which rains down on the local region with an especially intense and deadly fallout."" The Pentagon is due to send its report on mini-nukes to Congress in July, the same time a separate and comprehensive review of US strategic nuclear deterrence is likely to be published. One thing is certain. As Paul Rogers, professor of peace studies at Bradford University, puts it: ""Building new nuclear weapons is firmly on the agenda of the Bush administration."" Whether it involves the development of mini-nukes or a new version of the Minuteman intercontinental ballis tic missile system or a new Trident 3 system for nuclear submarines, it will lead to increasing pressure within the US to resume nuclear tests, a move which could destroy the comprehensive test ban treaty which Washington has yet to ratify. This, coupled with the growing debate in the US about using nuclear weapons in limited or regional wars, has the most serious implications for nuclear proliferation and arms control treaties already threatened by the Bush administration's determination to go ahead with a missile defence system. There is talk now in the US about nuclear weapons in this project, too. Nuclear warheads, so the argument runs, would be most effective in knocking out incoming missiles. That's one more reason to worry.",2001-04-25T02:12:38Z,"{'polarity': 0.05879746585226036, 'subjectivity': 0.3945100713593863}",0.3945100713593863
world/2001/apr/07/israel,France joins US attack on new Israeli settlement plan,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/07/israel,"France joined the US yesterday in condemning as provocative Israel's plan to expand Jewish settlement in the West Bank, a move that has incensed the Palestinians. The French rebuke to the government of the hardline rightwinger Ariel Sharon was unusually stark by diplomatic standards. It claimed Israel had lost direction since he took over last month. As Israeli tanks and helicopter gunships hit Gaza, damaging a power station and a police post, a French foreign ministry spokesman, François Rivasseau, said: ""This downward spiral leads to more violence, more destruction and more suffering. The Israeli government has taken a wrong turning."" He cited recent developments such as ""the provocative announcement of the resumption of settlements in the occupied territories, the continuation of so-called extra-judicial murders, the military clashes in Gaza and attacks on the safety of negotiators."" France traditionally has been more inclined than other countries, especially Britain, to criticise Israel and take a more pro-Arab stance. Egypt, too, expressed alarm over the prospect of Israel consolidating its hold on parts of the West Bank by auctioning land for a further 700 houses. Palestinian leaders welcomed the US condemnation of the plan. The US state department called it provocative. There are 200,000 Jews living in often isolated pockets dotted around the West Bank and Gaza, among more than 3m Palestinians, who view the settlement expansion as part of a gradual land grab that has been going on for more than 50 years. The strategy of Mr Sharon, who initially pursued much the same policy as his predecessor, Ehud Barak, is becoming clearer. Whereas Mr Barak took reprisals for Palestinian attacks, Mr Sharon has opted for pre-emptive punitive strikes. The aim appears to be to try to bomb the Palestinians back to the negotiating table. Mr Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, said Israel will retaliate ""relentlessly from now on and Palestinian security installations will be considered targets as long as security forces fail to prevent attacks on Israelis"". The Israeli internal security minister, Uzi Landau, said its forces should hit Palestinian targets ""every day, hour after hour."" He added: ""The price we will exact from the Palestinian Authority will become intolerable."" In a hint of further assassinations by Israel, Mr Landau said Palestinian officials behind attacks on Israel are ""not immune to Israeli attack"" and that the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, should be declared a war criminal ""as one who specialises in attacking babies and shelling villages"". An Israeli helicopter attack on Gaza overnight was followed at daybreak by Palestinian mortar attacks on the Israeli settlement of Netzarim, south of Gaza city. Israeli tanks returned fire. There was also the by now almost ritual stone-throwing in Jerusalem by Palestinians returning from Friday prayers in the Old City. Injuries were minor. But the tension in Jerusalem is set to rise after Mr Sharon's announcement on Thursday that he had asked his security agencies to make arrangements for Jews to visit the disputed religious site, known to Arabs as Haram-ash-Sharif and to Jews as Temple Mount. Since the Palestinian uprising began, few other than Muslims have been allowed to visit the site. Mr Arafat's office warned that the order would increase the cycle of violence in the region and called on Islamic officials ""to prevent Israel from [taking] this destructive step and insulting the holy places"". In the West Bank, a leading Islamic militant killed in a boobytrapped phone explosion was buried in the town of Jenin. Eight men in white robes, meant to symbolise death shrouds of suicide bombers, carried the flag-draped body of Iyad Hardan through the streets, followed by some 5,000 mourners demanding revenge.

world/2001/jun/11/mcveigh.usa4,McVeigh faces day of reckoning,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/11/mcveigh.usa4,"Just after dawn today in Indiana, 1pm in Britain, prison guards will open a series of valves allowing a cocktail of lethal chemicals to flow into Timothy McVeigh's body, in an execution which the US hopes will help put an end to the nightmare begun by the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. McVeigh's lawyers, who visited the 33-year-old convict in his last hours, described him as calm and ""rational in his demeanour"". He was said to be writing goodbye letters and watching television. In recent weeks McVeigh was reported to have put himself on a harsh diet, supposedly to enhance his image as a martyr, but at noon yesterday he was served a final meal of two pints of mint chocolate chip ice cream. A last-minute stay of execution from President Bush is unlikely, and McVeigh turned down a chance last week to appeal to the supreme court. Just after 4am yesterday he was driven the short distance from death row in Terre Haute penitentiary to its ""death house"", where he was ushered into a tiny holding cell with an observation window. His final statement, due to be made from the execution table, will be parsed for every nuance of meaning in a nation still looking for an explanation of why a decorated veteran from the American heartland should commit the worst act of domestic terrorism in US history, killing 168 people. McVeigh told journalists he would quote from Invictus, a 19th century poem by William Ernest Henley famous for the lines: ""I am the master of my fate/I am the captain of my soul."" In a letter to the Buffalo News daily in New York state yesterday, McVeigh used the word ""sorry"" for the first time, but instantly rendered it meaningless. ""I am sorry these people had to lose their lives,"" he wrote. ""But that's the nature of the beast. It's understood going in what the human toll will be."" There was anger in Oklahoma City yesterday after his claim that the bombing of a federal government building was a ""legit tactic"" in his war against the excesses of central government. Yesterday, his lawyer compared his role to that of a pilot who drops a bomb on a foreign country killing women and children. ""He does feel for people but he doesn't feel like he did anything wrong,"" Mr Nigh said. In his letter, McVeigh said he was an agnostic but that he would ""improvise, adapt and overcome"", if it turned out there was an afterlife. ""If I'm going to hell,"" he wrote, ""I'm gonna have a lot of company."" His body is to be cremated and his ashes scattered in a secret location. In his letter yesterday he showed impatience at the speculation that he was part of any plot, beyond the role played by an old army friend, Terry Nichols, currently serving a life term for helping put the 3,200kg bomb together. ""For those diehard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: show me where I needed anyone else,"" McVeigh wrote. ""Financing? Logistics? Specialised tech skills? Brainpower? Strategy? _ Show me where I needed a dark, mysterious 'Mr X'!"" A petition for the execution to be recorded and broadcast was turned down by the supreme court yesterday. The only people who will see a televised view of McVeigh's last moments will be about 330 survivors and victims' relatives in Oklahoma City who will see a closed-circuit broadcast. The live feed was organised after many survivors expressed a need to watch. The attorney general, John Ashcroft, said yesterday the broadcast would be encrypted to prevent bootleg copies being made. Among the witnesses in Terre Haute will be 10 journalists, 10 representatives of the survivors and up to four of McVeigh's invited guests, including his lawyers and a journalist-biographer. Gore Vidal, the author who earlier stirred controversy by agreeing to come as a ""friend"", was said to have other engagements in Italy. Just a few yards away will be the 19 surviving inmates on Terre Haute's death row who, according to church visitors, have taken to singing the hymn Amazing Grace in the lead up to the execution. Before today, the federal government had not executed anyone since 1963. Most executions are carried out by the state authorities. Now death row opponents fear the floodgates may have opened. Another convict, Juan Raul Garza, is to be executed next week. Sister Rita Gerardot, a Catholic nun who visits Terre Haute's death row, told the Guardian: ""It's a very sombre mood. There's a lot of tension among the men, because they know that's their fate. They're like sitting ducks now."" Protesters from each side of the death penalty debate will be allowed to gather in separate locations. Yesterday, however, the only sign of protest outside the prison was a middle-aged man in a white T-shirt and baseball cap worn backwards holding a sign saying: ""Pray for Tim's dad on Father's Day. God forgive all of us."" Harold Smith, 51, said he had driven from Albany, New York, to get his message across. He had recently been fired by the US post office and his 27-year marriage had collapsed. ""Anger, hurt, violence and death is no answer to anger, hurt, violence and death,"" he said. Some passing drivers offered him supportive toots on their horn, but many cursed and called for McVeigh to die. Mr Smith shrugged. ""The United States of America is such an angry place,"" he said.

world/2001/feb/17/iraq.michaelwhite,"For Bush and Blair, raids an act of male bonding",World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/17/iraq.michaelwhite,"For a centre-left European prime minister heading towards Washington for his first, awkward, encounter with a rightwing Republican newcomer in the White House, last night's decision to bomb Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries in Iraq must have felt like an act of cruel but lucky timing. The British-American attack will certainly help to steady nerves among military men and political analysts who have been quarrelling on both sides of the Atlantic as Tony Blair prepares to meet George Bush, scourge of Blair-Clinton third way politics, at Camp David next Friday. There have been threats of disagreement over the EU's rapid reaction force - ""European army"" in tabloid-speak. Potentially far more serious is the widespread alarm in Europe over the new administration's determination to press ahead with an anti-missile defence system to protect the US (but not, initially, its allies) from attack by so-called ""rogue states"" such as Iraq itself. In reality both projects are still little more than pipe dreams as practical military propositions. National missile defence (NMD), or ""son of Star Wars"", is technically difficult and largely untested. The rapid reaction force - 60,000 men and women at the ready for deployment on international peacekeeping missions - lacks cash, kit and political will to bring it into being. So a joint exercise, authorised from the British side by Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, is just what the doctor ordered as a convenient act of male bonding between two wary political leaders, one newly elected and keen to prove himself, the other soon to face the voters in search of a second term. Since Iraq cannot yet launch missiles against Brooklyn or Bromley there is, pilots apart, no risk to them or their voters. But it is not cost-free. In the days ahead, as Saddam Hussein makes the best propaganda use he can of the attacks, cynics who have seen the film Wag the Dog will say it is little more than a figleaf exercise for that purpose alone: a US president waging war for domestic political purposes, assisted by his most reliable - and docile - Nato ally. Too cynical perhaps. Last night the veteran leftwinger Tony Benn led immediate protests, demanding an end to the bombing. Some MPs in all parties, even thoughtful Tories, will agree with him that Blair's Britain is over-eager to prove itself as macho and as loyal to Washington as Margaret Thatcher. ""Neo-colonial"" is the phrase they will murmur. But Paul Keetch, a Liberal Democrat spokesman, endorsed the raids. Most Labour MPs will acquiesce so close to an election, aware that - despite qualms - Robin Cook's Foreign Office believes that Iraq is both a persistent threat to world peace and far less impoverished by sanctions than Saddam would have us believe. Few will march to Trafalgar Square. Even William Hague will be hard-pressed to jump on an anti-bombing bandwagon. The Tory leader has been promising to back US calls for the radar site at Fylingdales, North Yorkshire, to be upgraded to NMD specifications as a gesture of solidarity - in contrast to the Blair-Cook ""wait and see"" stance. The price may well be paid in fading hopes for the tattered Middle East peace process and rising oil prices, the result of regional uncertainty, which may damage the US economy and - sooner or later - that of Europe. Above all, it will again remind Britain's EU partners that, ""if forced to choose between Europe and the open sea"" (as Churchill put it) the UK will instinctively choose the open sea - and America beyond it.

world/2001/may/07/spain.gilestremlett,Eta kills regional leader of ruling party,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/07/spain.gilestremlett,"Gunmen from the Basque separatist group Eta were last night being blamed for the killing of Manuel Jimenez, regional leader of the Popular party of the prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, in the north-eastern Spanish city of Zaragoza. Jimenez, 53, was gunned down as he walked to the football stadium in Zaragoza to watch a match. He was president of the centre-right Popular party (PP) in the Aragon region. He was shot in the head twice by a gunman who fled on foot. Radio reports last night said the killing had been witnessed by his 16-year-old son, who was with him. Eyewitnesses said a man of about 25, with long hair and a baseball hat, had fired the shots at point blank range. The assassin was accompanied by a young woman. Cartridge shells from a 9mm pistol, the weapon usually used by Eta gunmen, were found nearby, police said. Jimenez became the twelfth PP politician to be killed by Eta since it began a campaign against its officials six years ago. That campaign has been intensified since Eta called off a 16-month ceasefire in December 1999. It has been extended to Socialist politicians, academics, journalists and prominent opponents of Eta. The group has been blamed for 25 deaths in shootings and bomb attacks since the end of the ceasefire. The latest killing comes a week before regional elections are due to be held for the parliament in the northern Basque country. Mr Aznar's PP hopes to wrest control of the regional government from the Basque Nationalist Party, which it accuses of being soft on separatists. An opinion poll in yesterday's edition of the newspaper El Pais showed that the PP in the Basque country, which is led by the former interior minister, Jaime Mayor Oreja, is close to achieving enough votes to govern in coalition with the Socialists.

world/2001/mar/28/israel,'Israelis seem more unmoved than ever',World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/28/israel,"Yesterday was another normal day in Israel. People rushed to work. The roads were jammed with traffic. The bustle on the streets of Tel Aviv was typical. Two weeks before Passover Israel's cities and towns are in full gear: this is the shopping season. People browse in the shops and malls. Others sit around in cafes and restaurants enjoying the spring sun. In Jerusalem, a car bomb explodes near a shopping centre. Four people are injured. Six months after the Palestinians launched a new round of political violence Israelis seem more unmoved than ever. The intifada is designed to persuade the Israeli public to end 33 years of occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and the continued daily humiliation of the 4m Palestinian inhabitants. The Palestinian Authority, led by its president Yasser Arafat, believed that if Israelis paid a heavy price in casualties and obstruction of daily life they would force their government to change its policy. The Palestinians, for their part, were ready to carry even a heavier burden: the human cost of this battle of attrition is high. Seventy Israeli civilians and servicemen have been killed and hundreds wounded in dozens of car bombs, suicide attacks and drive-by shootings in the occupied territories and inside Israel. On the Palestinian side, 350 have been killed and thousands injured at the hands of Israeli troops. Yet the achievement of the Palestinians' goals has never been more distant. Last month, Israelis elected the warrior Ariel Sharon as prime minister, leading a national unity cabinet. Instead of tiring or caving in, the Israeli reaction to the never ending attacks is surprising. It is an unusual response for a nation known for over reacting. This time the Israelis showed restraint and a sense of proportion. The result is a sharp contrast between the perception abroad of Israel as a society under siege and the domestic reality of the relative tranquility of daily life. Most Israelis, especially the younger generation, desire nothing more than to lead a normal life. True, Israel is not a homogeneous society.It has at least two faces. Tel Aviv represents one - secular, pluralist, vital and tolerant. Israel's other face is Jerusalem, its proclaimed capital, a city where political tensions, intoler ance, sectarian, religious and ideological divisions reign. Yet both cities represent a deeply held and sincere wish of the average Israeli to live and let live, like any modern, western society. But the ""normality"" of much of daily life might very soon be disrupted. The second terrorist attack - this time by a suicide bomber who failed to detonate his bomb inside a bus, but who killed himself and injured several passengers - could change this fragile reality. The public is still calm, despite sensational press reports and television images and the nearly hysterical tone of radio reports. But the pressure of the media is growing . As prime minister, Mr Sharon may yet be pushed to return to the old patterns of harsh responses and vengence seeking. Yossi Melman is a commentator with the Israeli daily newspaper Ha'aretz The price of conflict • At least 435 people have been killed and thousands injured since the intifada's revival in September last year • Of the dead, 357 have been Palestinian, 59 Jewish Israelis and the remainder Israeli Arabs or foreigners • The youngest person to die was a Jewish girl, aged 10 months, shot on Monday night in Hebron • The UN recently estimated the cost to the Palestinian economy inflicted by Israeli blockades at $1.2bn (about £800m) in the intifada's first four months.

world/2001/jun/10/theobserver,America holds vigil on McVeigh's last day,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/10/theobserver,"At seven o'clock this morning Timothy McVeigh will be moved from his cell on death row to the building where he will be put to death tomorrow for the Oklahoma bombing in 1995 in which 168 people died. By breakfast time tomorrow, two concerns pressing the people of Terre Haute, Indiana, will be settled: the winner of the state's beauty pageant will be known, and McVeigh, the most famous resident of this Midwestern town, will be dead. The accidental convergence of the two events is an inconvenience to this farming town. In the warm days of June, Terre Haute would rather be celebrating the curves of the state's corn-fed daughters than discussing a man who, according to recent reports, has starved himself to make his appearance more dramatic when the curtains are drawn back on the window of the execution chamber to reveal him strapped down and ready to go. As the town began to fill up yesterday with reporters, residents expressed weariness at the mention of McVeigh. 'That's all we ever hear about now,' said truck driver Jerry Eversol. 'It's time to do him in, like he did in 168 people.' The notoriety McVeigh has heaped upon Terre Haute has become an inescapable fact of life. 'We have no control over it,' said Rod Henry, president of the Greater Terre Haute Chamber of Commerce, who conceded he would rather be talking about the pageant. 'Frankly there is never going to be a good time for an event of this kind.' On a large, closely mown meadow between the muddy Wabash river and the penitentiary itself, a vast media encampment is being rebuilt a month after the last one came down when McVeigh's execution was delayed by the FBI's disclosure that it had found 4,000 pieces of evidence not disclosed to the defence. The growing city of tents, Portaloos and demarcated protest pens could be mistaken for a county fair. The prison has rented a marquee for press briefings; military tents housing barracked 'special forces' ring the perimeter in the unlikely event of trouble; and miles of cable run between satellite trucks and the grand stages from which the world's newscasters will report with gravity. Still, an air of purposelessness hangs over the media encampment. Besides the red-brick walls of the prison, razor wire and guard towers, there is little to view. The attention of the world's media will be trained on a small building it cannot see, reporting on an event it cannot witness, and there will be few demonstrators since many could not get here at such short notice. McVeigh's execution may be a strangely muted dénouement to a saga that began six years ago with a bomb blast. On Friday night the condemned man was moved from death row to a windowless 9ft by 14ft holding cell next to the death chamber where he will wait out his last hours. Officials are saying little: they will not discuss his last meal, his instructions on what is to be done with his body, whether he has spoken by telephone or in person with his lawyers, family or friends. On Friday prison warden Harley Lappin said he expected the execution to take as much as seven minutes, from the time he gives the signal to release the first of a stream of three lethal chemicals to death itself. To prevent any embarrassing hitch in the first federal execution in 38 years, executioners have been doing mock exercises last week. What is known of McVeigh mostly comes from his bitterly disappointed lawyers. 'He is preparing to die,' said Richard Burr, who had urged McVeigh to take his case for a stay of execution to the US Supreme Court after he was turned down by a lower appeals court on Thursday, an opportunity McVeigh rejected. 'He's letting go of life and saying his farewells. He's introspective and thoughtful.' According to a fellow inmate, David Paul Hammer, writing last month on the website deathrowspeaks.net, McVeigh gave away his possessions and has prepared himself with Spartan discipline. 'His expressions and his demeanour have changed,' Hammer wrote. 'He appears to be focused, very serious and stoic. His cell is neat, orderly and his bunk is made up military-style. His face is pulled tight and his body is slim to the point of resembling a starved person. At 6ft 2in, he weighs only 157lb. All of this by design, planned to the most minute detail.' There are no signs that McVeigh will deviate from his agenda now. The decorated Gulf War veteran who, aged just 26, built the fertiliser and fuel bomb that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Building on 19 April 1995 and damaged 300 buildings over a square mile, will remain an impenetrable figure of evil to most Americans. His refusal to repent, coupled with an engaging personality, is confounding. Unless he has a dramatic death-chamber change of heart, he will die with an intent to become a revolutionary martyr matched only by the determination of the Justice Department to ensure his swift dispatch. The FBI's incompetence in the case and still unanswered questions over alleged accomplices have only strengthened McVeigh's hand and threaten to confuse his legacy as a mass murderer. 'I think he'd rather go out as a martyr, and I think he will, in the minds of a small number of people,' said Monroe Gilmour, co-ordinator of a militia watchdog group in North Carolina. 'Once again, I think the tragedy is that McVeigh remains in control, rather than the government.' His death may also prove to be a turning point for opponents of the death penalty. Part of McVeigh's legacy, they suggest, will be to show that even an investigation costing $100 million still contained mistakes that amplify the likelihood of errors in other, less intensively investigated capital cases. Tomorrow, doubts about the death penalty will be apparent in Oklahoma City itself. 'People are starting to realise it doesn't accomplish anything,' said Patti Hall, who had 40 bones broken in the blast. 'You start to think, death doesn't deserve one more death.' But McVeigh will certainly die. In khaki trousers, a white shirt and slip-on shoes, he will be given the opportunity to deliver a few last words before the executioners open the taps. According to his biographers, those words will come from William Ernest Henley's defiant nineteenth-century poem Invictus : 'I am the master of my fate/I am the captain of my soul.'",2001-06-10T00:59:14Z,"{'polarity': 0.04319727891156465, 'subjectivity': 0.4256972789115646}",0.4256972789115646
world/2001/mar/13/israel1,Israel reduces pressure on West Bank,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/13/israel1,"Following international criticism, Israel's army has eased its chokehold on the town of Ramallah, the Palestinians' political and commercial centre, and loosened its blockade of four other West Bank towns. In Ramallah, soldiers opened the southern and northern access roads, but traffic was backed up for miles as troops searched each car. Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon has said the tight closure on Ramallah was imposed because Israeli security forces were trying to catch would be car bombers in the area. Chris Patten, the EU commissioner for external affairs, said after meeting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Gaza that the collapse of the Palestinian authority under economic pressure would not augur well for peace. ""We think it would be extremely bad for the prospects of peace if the [Palestinian] administration here was simply knocked to smithereens over the next few months,"" said Mr Patten, who is travelling with Swedish foreign minister Anna Lindh. ""If more people are plunged into poverty, that in our view is going to further radicalise opinion and make it more difficult to get people to accept the need for a political accommodation."" In Washington, the US state department said Israeli economic pressure on the Palestinians does not enhance security but causes hardships for Palestinian families. State department spokesman Richard Boucher called on Israel to release tax revenues to the Palestinians, and said it was important for the Palestinians to stop shootings and incitement and ""take steps to end the violence."" The Israeli army, meanwhile, denied reports that it tried to assassinate Marwan Barghouti, the head of Mr Arafat's Fatah movement in the West Bank, during a clash with Israeli troops in Ramallah yesterday. A Palestinian intelligence officer, 28-year-old Abdel Kader Abu Akroub, was killed by a shot to the chest as he stood near Barghouti during the confrontation. Israel has accused Mr Barghouti of directing gunmen who have attacked Israelis. Israel army radio quoted Fatah officials as saying Mr Barghouti had been the real target. ""I don't think they can justify their accusation,"" he said, adding that he would make some changes in his daily routine. The Israeli forces also destroyed two buildings today in the West Bank town of Beit Omar, near Hebron, saying Palestinian militants had used the structures for cover during recent shooting attacks. The strict closure on Ramallah was imposed on Sunday, after Israel said it had hard intelligence that a band of militants was planning to leave Ramallah for Jerusalem with a car bomb. Hamas has threatened to greet the new Sharon government with 10 suicide bomb attacks and took responsibility for two blasts in Israel this month, killing four Israelis. • Manners maketh the cabinet for Ariel Sharon, who has ordered the 25 politicians at his cabinet table to be punctual and polite. Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth listed the prime ministerial marching orders in an article today: be on time, keep comments to a minimum at government meetings - and never shout down a cabinet colleague. Sharon assembled his new troops for the first time yesterday. Yedioth Ahronoth said it was the first time ever a cabinet had begun on time. ""In the new government they treat time as if we were in England, not in Israel,"" housing minister Natan Sharansky complained. Talk about it What do you think?

world/2001/mar/28/comment.israelandthepalestinians,Jonathan Freedland on Israel in crisis,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/28/comment.israelandthepalestinians,"Who wins when a baby girl, just ten-months-old, is shot cleanly in the head? Who wins when the early morning is broken by the sound of a bomb? Who wins when the same city shudders from a second blast just a few hours later? Certainly not the Israelis, on the receiving end of that treatment yesterday. Not the family of Shalhavet Pass, who have lost a baby daughter. They may have chosen to live on the West Bank, in Hebron, a tiny enclave of 400 Jewish settlers surrounded by 120,000 Palestinians, but their daughter made no choice. As one Palestinian activist put it yesterday, she ""was a baby who didn't even know she was a settler"". So the Pass family are not winners. Nor are the citizens of Israel proper - those who have avoided the risks taken by the 400 hardliners of Hebron. They do not live in the heart of occupied territory; they are not driven by ideology. Yet they, too, feel nervous wherever they walk: yesterday's car bomb was left outside a Jerusalem supermarket. Nowhere is safe. In today's Israel a simple bus ride is a gamble with fate. Passengers eye each other cautiously: what if that man, over there, has dynamite strapped to his chest and is about to blow? So the Israelis are not winning. But are the Palestinians? The sniper who killed Shalhavet: did he gain something for his people or his cause? If so, what exactly? Six months to the day since this intifada began, it's time to ask: what good is coming from it? What is it for? Palestinians themselves are beginning to ask that question. For they are the ones paying for the uprising which erupted last September - paying for it in their blood, their children and their livelihoods. Just look at the death toll: more than 420 lives have been lost, but the overwhelming majority of them, 350, have been Palestinian - dozens of them kids. They have seen a 12-year-old boy, Muhammad al-Durrah, shot dead in his father's arms (just like Shalhavet). Each week another Palestinian infant is transformed into a ""martyr"". Palestinian lives are made next to impossible. Every attack on Israel brings another clampdown: either the closure of the West Bank and Gaza, choking off economic life in the territories, or ""internal closures"", cutting off movement between Palestine's cities, towns and villages. The result, says the United Nations, is a Palestinian economy losing $11m a day. But the biggest problem comes from the Israeli response to Palestinian gun attacks. TV audiences around the world probably believe this intifada is like the last one, back in the late 1980s: a battle of an armed Israeli Goliath against hundreds of young, stone-throwing Palestinian Davids. The current uprising certainly began that way - but it's changed. Now it is fought less by a mass movement than by an activist minority - using guns. The crack troops are the tanzim, Palestinian fighters who enjoy a half in, half out relationship with Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. It is the tanzim who fire on Jewish settlements and on Israeli army positions. Theirs is a time-honoured, anti-colonial strategy - a guerrilla war designed to make the occupiers' lives so unbearable they eventually have no choice but to leave. The problem is that, in the process, the tanzim are ruining the lives of their own people. For these fighters tend to use residential Palestinian neighbourhoods as their base, firing from building sites or hollowed-out ruins. The Israelis then hit back at the source of the fire, sending local people cowering into basements and back rooms to avoid getting hurt. The result is a surge in casualties among Palestinian families who are shooting no bullets - but live too close to those who do. The killing of baby Shalhavet is a case in point: Israelis immediately hit back, with machine-gun fire and shells, wounding 16 Palestinians including a three-year-old boy. That Arab toddler did not kill the Jewish baby, but he paid the price all the same. Now a backlash is underway. As Suzanne Goldenberg reports today, a range of Palestinians, from the grassroots to the elite, is beginning to rebel against the gunmen who are drawing the Israelis' fire. ""We don't want to be accused of opposing the intifada,"" Ahmed Orabi, a Palestinian resident of Al Bireh told the New York Times. ""But there is no rationale for what these thugs are doing. Their actions are risking the safety of the whole neighbourhood."" And before you write Mr Orabi off as some unrepresentative moderate, note that the de facto commander of the uprising, Marwan Barghouti, has also condemned shootings from populated areas - while Hamas says the tanzim are driving Palestinians out of their own neighbourhoods. On a Palestinian radio talk show last month, one speaker warned that unless Arafat brought the young gunmen into line, West Bank residents would not only abandon their villages - they would emigrate altogether. Besides this most practical cost, the intifada is hurting the Palestinians politically. Israeli public opinion, which was beginning to gird itself for enormous concessions to the Palestinians, hardens every day. Every attack on a Jewish civilian, every car bomb, makes an Israeli consensus to give up land, or to divide Jerusalem, more remote. All this is prompting some serious second thoughts among Palestinian circles. Journalist Daoud Kuttab's website asks, ""Where is all this leading to? Shouldn't we have accepted the Clinton ideas? Where does the return to 70s and 80s rhetoric get us? Are we entering into a dark tunnel without an end in sight?"" Some suggest changing the intifada into a non-violent, Gandhi-style rebellion, perhaps blasting Jewish settlements with Palestinian music or prayers for 24 hours a day - that would soon drive them away, says one activist. Others want to look again at that Clinton-brokered offer, rejected by Arafat last year. Admittedly, that Camp David plan had deep flaws. The map of the putative Palestine was a swiss cheese, full of holes; and Israel did not accept that 3.7m Palestinian refugees should have the right to return, a move most Israelis believe would amount to national suicide. But the basis of a deal was there, especially in the beefed-up form on offer in January: the Palestinians could've built on it. It would have paved the way for statehood and a share of Jerusalem, including Palestinian control over the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif. So no wonder many Palestinians are looking back wistfully at that offer now. The naive among them think they can still have it, by restarting talks with Ariel Sharon and picking up where they left off. But Sharon is not the same as his predecessor, Ehud Barak: that deal is not on the table. And, with Bill Clinton gone, the Palestinians no longer have a US president obsessed with middle east peace: when they ring Washington now, they'll be lucky to get their call returned. No, the Palestinian tragedy is to be locked into an uprising that is hurting them more than their enemy - guided by a leadership with a fateful talent for missing history's moment. jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com",2001-03-28T02:14:18Z,"{'polarity': 0.04716592930878645, 'subjectivity': 0.3552043194900336}",0.3552043194900336
world/2001/may/21/israel5,What the papers say,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/21/israel5,"The Israeli press The Jerusalem Post reports that the Israeli security cabinet has approved further ""pinpoint"" attacks on Palestinian targets. It has also authorised an inner committee of prime minister Ariel Sharon, foreign minister Shimon Peres and defence minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer to approve further attacks without consulting cabinet colleages. The report notes laconically: ""The members of the security cabinet made it known, however, that they expect to be informed of the activity soon after a event, and not to learn about it through the media."" Ina Friedman, in the news magazine Jerusalem Report, tackles another highly contentious issue: Israel's systematic pre-emptive assassinations of Palestinian militants. She says that deputy defence minister Ephraim Sneh has no qualms on the policy: ""'Look, we are engaged in a war against terrorism, but every measure we take is criticised,' says Sneh, an ex-head of the civil administration in the [occupied] territories. ""'Tanks are too brutal; helicopter gunships are an indiscriminate and excessive use of force: what are we expected to do? To take the most precise, selective and surgical mode of countermeasures. Those who preach to us tend to forget that our first responsibility is to protect Israelis. If I know that somebody... is preparing a car bomb, what am I supposed to do? Write him a warning letter? Send him a subpoena?'"" Palestine and regional Arabic press The latest daily summary of the Palestinian press, translated by the Palestinian National Authority's Palestinian ministry of information, is full of fiery references to ""war criminal Sharon"", and Israel's ""barbaric occupation"". Interestingly, for its commentary slot the ministry selects a piece from an Israeli paper rather than a Palestinian. It's easy to see why - this is what Doron Rosenblum has to say in Ha'aretz: ""Sending in F-16s for a failed revenge strike against a few Kalashnikov-bearing gunmen in Nablus, almost at the end of the aircrafts' runway, symbolizes the depth of the desperation, the dizzy spin, the political and military bankruptcy reached by the Sharon government after 100 days in office. ""It may also symbolize the beginning of the end of its term. After all, in the absence of a political-social-economic agenda, what agenda could it offer, if it has already reached the bottom of the barrel? And what would happen after a terror attack in which, God forbid, 20 people were killed? An atomic bomb on Ramallah?"" In a timely piece for al-Ahram weekly in Cairo, the pre-eminent Palestinian intellectual Edward Said writes acidly of leaders who went out of their way to court American support and approval: ""Even as I write, American weapons of mass destruction, supplied in unlimited number to Israel, are being used illegally - according to US law - to attack, kill, and maim unprotected Palestinian men, women and children, to demolish their houses, raze their refugee camps, make their lives basically unlivable. ""Yet for some years a policy of trying without reason or dignity to woo American leaders in the most vulgar way possible has been implemented, as if the personal pleasure and satisfaction of Hilary [Clinton] or Madeleine [Albright] bought at the expense of Palestinian public money were a form of policy rather than an indecent display of bribery of a sort."" The US press It's difficult to find much sympathy for the Palestinians in the American papers, which are broadly as pro-Israeli as the government in Washington. In the Miami Herald, for example, syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer launches a diatribe on the Palestinian National Authority, heaping all the blame for the current bloodshed on Yasser Arafat. Krauthammer offers this explanation: ""He is fighting because the Jew-free Palestinian state is hardly his only goal. There will be no peace, he pledged, until the millions of Palestinians living abroad are returned to Israel - and thus extinguish it as a Jewish state. Palestine first, then Israel. For decades the West assured Israel that its security depended on 'land for peace'. Arafat, it turns out, is fighting for land without peace."" The Houston Chronicle reports that the secretary of state, Colin Powell, is shortly to present new peace proposals, ""but will stop short of immediate full-blown intercession"". The report goes on: ""Though Powell apparently is edging closer to taking on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the administration seems to be aware that the chances of making headway are slim. ""One official, sounding exasperated, said the heightened violence Friday showed that the two sides 'are not exhausted by this', and that they were intent on pursuing ever more revenge. But, the official added, the situation has become so bad that Washington has little choice but to try."" In the Sunday opinion pages of the Los Angeles Times, David Grossman writes from Jerusalem that Israel is slipping back into a dangerous psychology of victimhood: ""Every threat - even from the Palestinians, who can never defeat Israel on the battlefield - is perceived as an absolute peril justifying the harshest response. ""Unlike during other, similarly difficult periods in the past, Israelis today have no hope. Only hope can impel them to try to extricate themselves from this fatal ossification. 'You can't make peace with the Arabs' is the sentence that this writer hears several times a day, every time he foolishly gets into a debate on the street, in a taxi or on a radio program. With a small difference, it is the same statement he hears in debates with Palestinians: 'You can't make peace with the Israelis.' The prophecies are liable to fulfill themselves.""

world/2001/may/05/israel,Report condemns Israeli expansion,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/05/israel,"A US-led investigation into the causes of the Middle East conflict calls for Israel to halt the illegal expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. The big increase in settlements over the last decade, often provocatively placed on hilltops overlooking Palestinian towns and villages, is one of the biggest causes of Palestinian hatred of Israelis. Draft copies of the former US senator George Mitchell's report have been handed to the Israelis and Palestinians for comment before a final version is published later this month. Mr Mitchell and his team have been deliberately even-handed in order to avoid fuelling high tensions. Palestinians blame the start of fighting on the visit by Ariel Sharon to the holy site known to Arabs as the Noble Sanctuary and to Israelis as Temple Mount. The report says the visit was not the direct cause but a contributing factor. There was more disappointment for the Palestinians when Mr Mitchell rejected their call for an international observer force to protect them from the Israeli army. In a further piece of juggling, the report calls for the Palestinians to stop firing at Israelis from civilian areas and urges Israelis to show restraint when returning fire to avoid excessive injuries to civilians. The Palestinian information minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo, said the document gave a ""firm and clear rejection of all settlement activity"". Although the Israeli government insists it has imposed a freeze on new settlements, it is encouraging the expansion of existing ones. The Palestinians say this is taking place even though there are empty flats and houses in the existing settlements and the Israeli government is finding it increasingly hard to get people to go to the West Bank and Gaza. Violence continued yesterday when four Palestinians wanted by Israel were injured in an explosion in the West Bank. Palestinian sources said they were members of the Islamic militant group Hamas who were carrying a bomb that went off prematurely. Elsewhere on the West Bank, there was trouble at flashpoints that have almost become a Friday ritual, such as a roundabout in Ramallah and the old city of Jerusalem, where Palestinians threw rocks at Jews praying at the Western Wall below.",2001-05-05T00:04:01Z,"{'polarity': -0.017812121212121217, 'subjectivity': 0.36344848484848474}",0.36344848484848474
world/2001/jun/20/russia.julianborger,Putin fires arms race warning,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/20/russia.julianborger,"The Bush administration's decision to press ahead with a new missile defence system could trigger a new arms race, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, warned in interviews published in the US yesterday. He said the proposed National Missile Defence (NMD) system would destroy the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and lead to the collapse of the arms control treaties currently underpinning global stability. The result would be a ""hectic uncontrolled arms race"" among Russia's neighbours and would spark Russian rearmament. In the course of a lengthy audience in the Kremlin with nine US news organisations, Mr Putin cast doubt on the technical feasibility of NMD, which involves spotting incoming missiles from space and then hitting them with ground or sea-launched US missiles. However, he made it clear Russia would not take any chances. Moscow would order the upgrading of the country's nuclear forces, he said, replacing single warheads with multiple warheads. This, he said, would cost only ""a meagre amount of money"" but the Russian arsenal would be ""augmented multifold"". The Russian leader complained about steps the US had already taken towards upgrading its radar systems in apparent readiness for NMD, in particular the modernisation of a radar installation in Varde, Norway, which he pointed out was half a world away from the ""rogue states"" about which President Bush has expressed concern, but just over the border from Russia. He appeared particularly angered by a suggestion from Mr Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, that the US should build the proposed National Missile Defence (NMD) system whether Russia agreed or not. ""When we hear that some programme or other will be carried out 'with or without us' - well, we cannot force anyone to cooperate with us, nor will we try to."" He added: ""We have offered to work together. If that is not needed, fine. We are ready to act on our own."" Mr Putin said he and Mr Bush had established a high level of trust at their weekend summit in Slovenia. But by taking the unprecedented step of opening the Kremlin to the US press, Mr Putin was clearly anxious to counter White House spin suggesting he had bowed to the inevitability of the proposed gigantic US defence system. ""If one would imagine that we would throw away the ABM treaty, it would mean that automatically the Start I and Start II (arms control treaties) are thrown in the trash immediately,"" he said. Alongside these dire warnings, however, President Putin was also keen to point out the positive aspects of the meeting. He suggested Russian and US intelligence work together to counter the threat of nuclear proliferation, but he said the two countries ""do not have a common position"" on the seriousness of the threat. He denied allegations that Russia was supplying Iran with technology which could be used in the building of a nuclear bomb and played down the danger posed by North Korea, another potential threat cited by Washington as a justification for building the NMD system.",2001-06-20T10:26:12Z,"{'polarity': 0.004914622414622413, 'subjectivity': 0.3861682845773755}",0.3861682845773755

world/2001/feb/09/stuartjeffries,French court links armed robbers to terrorist network,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/09/stuartjeffries,"French police have uncovered an international terrorist network, with links to the millionaire Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, which smuggled Islamic militants into western Europe on false papers, a Paris court heard yesterday. The network, which had members in three continents but is believed to have its roots in Bosnia, also has links with an armed gang which was responsible for a spate of armed robberies and a possible terrorist attack in the north of France in the mid-90s. Police suspicions about the ""Roubaix gang"" were raised following the robbery of a Brink's security van in a supermarket car park near Roubaix in northern France in March 1996, using grenades, machine guns and rocket launchers. Four days later in Lille, a bomb partially exploded in front of the city's main police station. If it had worked properly the bomb would have ""devastated everything within a radius of 300 metres of the blast"". The attack occurred two days before Lille played host to a G7 conference of finance and social affairs ministers. Investigators believed that the two attacks and several other armed robberies were perpetrated by the same small gang operating from a house in Roubaix. When officers from the anti-terrorist police unit (the GIGN) raided the house in the spring of 1996, there was a gun battle in which four suspected members of the gang were killed. The surviving members of the gang tried to flee western Europe immediately afterwards. Two of them, Lionel Dumont, a Bosnian who converted to Islam, and Mouloud Bougelane, also known as Souleymane, were involved in a shoot-out with police officers in Belgium a few days later. But they escaped and, according to police information, went to Bosnia. Dumont was later arrested there, but escaped from his prison cell. In Paris yesterday, 28 people appeared in court accused of being members of a network which had supplied false papers to militants, most of them former Bosnian and Afghan soldiers. French, Turkish and Italian police forces collaborated to expose what a French police witness called ""a triangular network in the traffic of false documents between Belgium, Canada and Turkey"". French members of the network are believed to be linked to Bin Laden. The president of the court, Michele Bernard-Requin, said that some of the accused had links with the Roubaix gang, but most had only participated in smuggling illegal immigrants in and out of France. The court heard that the network is headed by four men and was at one time based in Quebec. Only one of them, Fateh Kamel, was present in court yesterday. Another suspected leader, Ahmed Ressam, faces trial in the US on charges of carrying explosives through customs and the other two are on the run. Several men suspected of belonging to the Roubaix gang will go on trial next month at Douai in northern France, accused of armed robbery and attempted murder. The French revelations come to light in the same week as four suspected terrorists, all believed to have been collaborating with Bin Laden, appeared in a US court, charged with the murders of 224 people at US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998. Yesterday Pakistan's military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, said in an interview with an Egyptian newspaper that the Taliban might hand over Bin Laden for trial by Islamic judges in a Muslim country, but would never send him to the US. He added that he did not see why a third country could not be the trial venue, as in the Lockerbie bombing case.",2001-02-09T03:29:14Z,"{'polarity': -0.019318181818181825, 'subjectivity': 0.24886363636363631}",0.24886363636363631
uk/2001/jun/14/race.world,Community leaders call for Oldham riot inquiry,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jun/14/race.world,"Police, MPs and civic leaders from Oldham are today meeting the home secretary, David Blunkett, to ask for an independent review into race relations in the town. Tension had been building in the town in Greater Manchester for several weeks before erupting into violence just over two weeks ago, when gangs of whites and Asians clashed. Oldham council leader, Richard Knowles, said: ""We will be telling Mr Blunkett that our immediate priority is to restore peace and calm to Oldham and that we are working hard to achieve this, together with all sections of the borough's population."" The group, which includes Greater Manchester Chief Constable David Wilmot, the council's chief executive, and local Labour MPs Michael Meacher, Phil Woolas and David Heyes, had written to the prime minister requesting the talks and received an immediate response. No Asian community leaders are among the delegation meeting David Blunkett and other ministers this afternoon. Mr Knowles said that was ""clear recognition at national level of the situation we are facing here in Oldham and the need to deal with it promptly."" He added: ""We will call on the new home secretary to back the idea of an independent review which would look at the responsibilities of the police and the council to promote good race relations within Oldham."" The group will call on the review to report within three to four months and for the findings to be made public. Ashid Ali, of the Bangladeshi Youth Association, said it would be wrong to criticise the delegation for not having any Asian members among it. ""I am not surprised but ... we need to understand these people who are actually in the delegation are high profile people,"" Mr Ali told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""These are people who are elected by their party representatives, and Oldham Council does have Asian members. ""It would be nice if we could have someone from Asian origin but the last thing we need to do is distinguish this delegation in terms of race. ""What we need to look at is why this delegation is going and how they can come back and improve the town."" Labour MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, Phil Woolas, told BBC Radio Five Live: ""This is a complete nonsense that the composition of the delegation is even an issue."" He said those involved in the Home Office briefing just happened to all be white. ""What is important is the agenda of the meeting - what measures will be taken to ensure law and order and confidence-building among all our community,"" he added.

world/2001/mar/03/warcrimes.germany,French court strikes blow against fugitive Nazi,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/03/warcrimes.germany,"A Paris court yesterday sentenced in absentia Alois Brunner - Adolf Eichmann's right-hand man and the world's highest-ranking Nazi fugitive believed still alive - to life imprisonment for sending hundreds of Jewish children to their deaths at Auschwitz. ""Life imprisonment is too good for him,"" said Henri Zajdenwerger, 73, who lost 14 members of his family to Brunner's SS henchmen during the war and was among dozens of protesters outside the courthouse yesterday. ""But in reality he has never paid for his crimes, and he never will."" In all, Brunner, who fled to Syria after the war and is now 88 if he is still alive, is held responsible for sending some 140,000 European Jews to the gas chambers. Nearly 24,000 of them were deported from the notorious Drancy transit camp outside Paris, where Brunner was commandant from June 1943 to August 1944. The former Gestapo officer was sentenced to death twice in his absence in the 1950s, but had never been charged with the specific crime addressed in yesterday's hearing - the arrest and deportation of 345 orphans from the Paris region. Aged between 15 days and 18 years old, the children were packed into cattle trains and shipped off to Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen death camps in August 1944, just weeks before the Allies liberated Paris. Only 61 survived. ""Alois Brunner must be considered the true organiser of the deportation of Jews from France between June 1943 and August 1944,"" said the investigating magistrate Hervé Stephan, who presented the case to the court. ""These final arrests sprang from a desire to deport and to exterminate the very last Jewish children it was still possible to find on French soil."" The French Nazi-hunter Serge Klarsfeld, who spent nearly 15 years bringing the case to court, admitted that without a defendant the trial was largely symbolic - an effort to honour the names and the memories of victims like Celestine Ajzykowicz, 11, Jean Bender, four, and Alain Blumberg, a two-week-old baby kicked to death by an SS guard. ""This was a case where the culpability of the defendant did not have to be proven,"" said Mr Klarsfeld, whose own father, arrested in in Nice in 1943, was among Brunner's early victims. ""But what counts here is the victims. It was important to me to have the names of these children pronounced solemnly in a French courtroom."" Syria has always denied harbouring the Austrian-born Brunner, who, before arriving in France in 1943, emptied Vienna of 43,000 Jews and Salonika of 46,000; in the last days of the Reich he managed to deport another 13,500 from Slovakia. ""We don't know anything about Brunner,"" a Syrian official said this week. But despite denying knowledge of his whereabouts, Damascus has consistently barred French investigators from entering the country and has several times refused entry to Mr Klarsfeld. Brunner fled Germany only in 1954, on a fake Red Cross passport, moving first to Egypt and then to Syria where he assumed the name Georg Fischer. In 1961 he lost an eye to a letter bomb sent to his Damascus address in the rue Georges Haddad, by the French secret service, allegedly because he was selling arms to the Algerian liberation movement. Another letter bomb, sent this time by the Israeli secret service, blew off four fingers of his right hand in 1980. In 1985 he gave an interview, illustrated with photographs taken in the Syrian port of Lattaquie, to the German magazine Bunte, saying he had ""no regrets whatsoever"". He was last seen alive by reliable witnesses in 1992. The Jewish rights organisation the Simon Wiesenthal Centre accused Syria of hiding the truth. ""Until Damascus produces either the man or evidence of his demise, the trauma of his victims' families will not be concluded,"" its director for international liaison, Shimon Samuels, said. ""Brunner is anti-semitism at its most extreme,"" said Mr Klarsfeld, responsible for tracking down Klaus Barbie, the Lyon Gestapo chief. ""What business did he have rounding up these little children? I know them in a way, I feel affection for them; I fought to get hold of their photographs. What can we give to the dead if not our loyalty?"" • Additional reporting by Celine Bruneau",2001-03-03T02:19:03Z,"{'polarity': 0.05209551656920077, 'subjectivity': 0.34616680590364796}",0.34616680590364796
world/2001/feb/06/september11.usa,Absent Bin Laden dominates US trial,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/06/september11.usa,"The name of the elusive Osama bin Laden dominated the proceedings of America's biggest trial yesterday, in which four men are accused of a conspiracy that culminated in the bombing of two US embassies in Africa and 224 deaths. ""The story that's about to unfold is long, complicated and challenging,"" the assistant US attorney Paul Butler told the jury as he opened the case for the prosecution. ""But at the core the charges are simple. They are that all four defendants entered into an illegal agreement with Bin Laden to kill Americans anywhere in the world. Each helped the best they could, and 224 men, women and children lost their lives."" The four men, two of whom face the death penalty if convicted of direct involvement in the bombings of the embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in August 1998, were led into court with their hands cuffed behind their backs and their feet shackled. Outside, a fork-lift truck rearranged blocks of concrete in front of metal barriers at the entrance to the the old federal courthouse in Manhattan. Two hydraulically operated steel barricades were placed across a road running alongside, designed to halt a truck travelling at 50mph. Cameras with night vision and capable of reading a newspaper a block away monitored the area. Inside courtroom 318, where the trial of those accused of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre was also held, sniffer dogs searched for explosives. Those attending the trial had to pass two sets of metal detectors. ""The bombings were neither the beginning nor the end of a terrorist plot to kill Americans,"" Mr Butler said.""In the blink of an eye everything changed. What [the bombings] did to human beings that day defies description. Words and numbers cannot describe the horror."" Mohammed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, a 24-year-old Saudi Arabian, is accused of being in the vehicle that carried the Nairobi bomb, and 27-year-old Khalfan Khamis Mohammed, from Tanzania, is accused of being in the truck that contained the explosives in Dar es Salaam. The other two, said to have been involved in the wider conspiracy, face life in jail if convicted. They are Wadih el-Hage, a 40-year-old American citizen born in the Lebanon and said to have been Mr Bin Laden's personal secretary, and MohamedSaddiq Odeh, a Jordanian, 35, who is accused of running a fishing business to support the group in Kenya. They plead not guilty. The prosecution is expected to use contested confessions, and computer and telephone records in the course of the trial, which could last up to a year. Whittling down the jury to 12 members and six alternates from a pool of 1,300 took a month in itself. In all, 22 men have been charged with involvement in the conspiracy to kill Americans: the four on trial in Manhattan, another who will face the court later, one who has pleaded guilty and is expected to be a star witness for the prosecution, three who are fighting extradition from the United Kingdom, and 13 who remain at large, including Mr Bin Laden. He is believed to be in Afghanistan. Ali Mohammed, a naturalised American from Egypt who has admitted taking part in the plot, told an earlier hearing that he had been sent by Mr Bin Laden to scout the US embassy in Nairobi. ""Bin Laden looked at the picture of the embassy and pointed to where a truck could go as a suicide bomber,"" he said. Another man who will testify against the four is known only as CS-1. The man, believed to be a convicted terrorist, says he worked for Mr Bin Laden until five years ago. Robert Precht, who was a lawyer for one of the defendants in the World Trade Centre trial, said outside the court yesterday: ""In this trial the mastermind [of the plot] has already been manufactured by the extensive press coverage, the attacks by politicians on Bin Laden, and even the public statements and military actions of former President [Bill] Clinton. ""To the extent that Bin Laden has become a focal point, he becomes a ready-made mastermind for the defence,"" he said. In the dock: the accused Khalfan Khamis Mohammed Age 27, from Tanzania Sometimes called ""KK"", he is accused of riding in the bomb-laden truck to the embassy in Tanzania. He was detained in South Africa in October 1999, and faces the death penalty. He allegedly rented a house as the bomb factory. Wahid el-Hage Age 40, from Texas Born in Lebanon, said to be Osama bin Laden's former secretary. Raised a Roman Catholic, he converted to Islam. In the late 70s he attended the University of South-western Louisiana. In 1992 he went to work for Bin Laden in Sudan and Kenya. The father of seven, he was back in Texas by 199. He now says he is a college freshman living in the 70s and can't remember his family. Mohamed Saddiq Odeh Age 35, from Jordan Arrested days after the Nairobi bombing when he tried to enter Pakistan. Alleged to have said he went to Kenya for five days before the attacks and met an explosives expert who led the Kenyan terrorism cell. Prosecutors say he stayed with other group members at the Hilltop Hotel in Kenya, before travelling on August 5 to meet Osama bin Laden. They said he told them that all the plotters except one had left Kenya a day before the attack, shaving their beards to avoid suspicion. He has a wife and child in Jordan. Mohammed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali Age 24, from Saudi Arabia Arrested five days after the bombing in Nairobi, he was interviewed extensively by the FBI. Prosecutors say he denied having a role but changed his story, saying he rode in the truck and threw a stun grenade at guards. Allegedly he discarded two keys to the padlock of the vehicle at a hospital. He says his confession was coerced. If convicted he could be executed.",2001-02-06T16:31:12Z,"{'polarity': -0.019564414913252125, 'subjectivity': 0.3191768180140273}",0.3191768180140273
world/2001/may/06/mcveigh.usa,The McVeigh letters,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/06/mcveigh.usa,"The indepth letters Timothy McVeigh invited the Observer to look at were sent to the safekeeping of his friend Bob Papovich who had up until now been told that the correspondence was to be kept 'off-the-record'. But in a letter to Papovich written from death row on May 3, 2001. McVeigh told Papovich that these documents he had sent him contained 'the final piece missing from the ""why"" equation.' In a letter to Observer journalist Tracy McVeigh, the convicted Oklahoma City bomber gave Papovich's phone number and pleaded: 'Ask him specifically for my 3-page letter ""why I bombed the Murrah building'. The following is that letter which shows the build-up of anger that McVeigh had against a US federal government 'run amok' against its citizens and the politics that led to his bombing of the Alfred P Murrah building in Oklahoma City on April 19 1995 - the second anniversary of Waco. What McVeigh wrote: 'I explain herein why I bombed the Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City. I explain this not for publicity, nor seeking to win an argument of right or wrong. I explain so that the record is clear as to my thinking and motivations in bombing a government installation. ""I chose to bomb a federal building because such an action served more purposes than other options. Foremost the bombing was a retaliatory strike; a counter attack for the cumulative raids (and subsequent violence and damage) that federal agents had participated in over the preceding years (including, but not limited to, Waco). From the formation of such units as the FBI's Hostage Rescue and other assault teams amongst federal agencies during the 80s, culminating in the Waco incident, federal actions grew increasingly militaristic and violent, to the point where at Waco, our government - like the Chinese - was deploying tanks against its own citizens. Knowledge of these multiple and ever-more aggressive raids across the country constituted an identifiable pattern of conduct within and by the federal government and amongst its various agencies. 'For all intents and purposes, federal agents had become soldiers (using military training, tactics, techniques, equipment, language, dress, organisation and mindset) and they were escalating their behaviour. Therefore this bombing was meant as a pre-emptive (or pro-active) strike against these forces and their command and control centres within the federal building. When an aggressor force continually launches attacks from a particular base of operations, it is sound military strategy to take the fight to the enemy. Additionally, borrowing a page from US foreign policy, I decided to send a message to a government that was becoming increasingly hostile, by bombing a government building and the government employees within that building who represent that government. Bombing the Murrah federal building was morally and strategically equivalent to the US hitting a government building in Serbia, Iraq, or other nations. Based on observations of the policies of my own government, I viewed this action as an acceptable option. From this perspective, what occurred in Oklahoma City was no different than what Americans rain on the heads of others all the time, and subsequently, my mindset was and is one of clinical detachment. (The bombing of the Murrah building was not personal, no more than when Air Force, Army, Navy or Marine personnel bomb or launch cruise missiles against government installations and their personnel). I hope that this clarification amply addresses all questions. Another letter sent to Papovich stated: ""When the post-inferno investigations and inquiries by the Executive and Legislative branches of government concluded that the federal government had done nothing fundamentally wrong during the raid of the Branch Davadians at Waco, the system not only failed the victims who died during that siege but also failed the citizens of this country. This failure in effect left the door open for more Wacos.' McVeigh went on to the window of opportunity for federal agents to be held accountable for their crimes against ""we the people"" was again slammed shut during the court process when the US courts held that federal agents were not accountable for 'the massive loss of lives and property as well as an absolute denial of due process.' ""Some time after the fact they received awards, bonus pay and in some cases promotions for their disgusting and inhumane actions at Waco and Ruby Ridge. ""This was exemplified years later while I sat in prison, The Ruby Ridge FBI sniper, Lon Horiuchi, was charged by the state of Idaho for his actions. ""The federal courts threw out the charges, ruling that federal agents are immune from the laws that govern the common citizen. 'The surviving Davidians were sentenced to lengthy prison terms, despite protests from the trial jurors. The primary ""checks and balances"" system had again failed to correct the system. 'It was at this time, after waiting for non-violent checks and balances to correct ongoing federal abuses and seeing no such results, that the assault weapons ban was passed and rumours subsequently surfaced of nationwide, Waco-style raids scheduled for the spring of 1995 to confiscate firearms. 'These rumours were so persistent and deemed so credible that some congresswoman wrote letters to Attorney-General Janet Reno inquiring as to her intents and admonishing her to call off the raids. ""As it turns out these rumours were actually based on fact. ""Through the legal process called 'discovery' the Oklahoma City bombing defence learned that both the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) and the FBI had formulated raid plans for the spring of 1995 at Elohim City in eastern Oklahoma. So for those who dismiss such concerns as paranoia you need to look at the facts as they existed at the time and further reflect that the Waco raid was not imaginary - it was a real event. ""It was in this climate then, that I reached the decision to go on the offensive - to put a check on government abuse of power where others has failed in stopping the federal juggernaut run amok.",2001-05-06T17:21:42Z,"{'polarity': -0.04614955357142857, 'subjectivity': 0.43156622023809527}",0.43156622023809527
world/2001/jan/31/zimbabwe.comment,Editor of Zimbabwe's newspaper won't give up under fire,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/31/zimbabwe.comment,"On Sunday morning, as I prepared for work, Anne Musonza the editor-in-chief's secretary, called me on my mobile and told me the news that ""they"" had bombed our printing press a few hours earlier. ""We can't print anything."" ""They"", if you ask me in the heat of that moment, were the war veterans, a rag-tag group of won't-works who claim to have fought in the liberation war in the 70s. Most are too young to have fought in the war, which ended 20 years ago. They are led by a doctor trained in Poland, Chenjerai Hunzvi, who never held a rifle during the war itself. He had twice led noisy demonstrations at the our editorial offices in downtown Harare the previous week. Then, at a press conference, he had announced that the war veterans were ""banning"" the newspaper - by which we thought he meant they would not allow the paper to be circulated in areas which they controlled. They had already burnt copies of the paper after we had carried the results of a survey in which the majority of the people interviewed in Harare had said they hoped Laurent Kabila's death would result in the withdrawal of the 12,000 Zimbabwean soldiers from Congo. The war veterans, led by Hunzvi, managed to impute that the Daily News had cooked up the survey - as the government had done when we carried out a survey before the election in June last year which showed that President Mugabe's Zanu PF had lost popularity and would not win all the 120 seats being contested. In the event, they won only 62 and most of those in the rural areas. But on the Monday after the explosion which ripped through the small refurbished Goss printing press, I was walking from my house in Chitungwiza, 40km from Harare, when I met a 10-year-old boy with two loaves of bread. The price of bread had recently gone up again. For a while I saw very few people with bread on my daily walk to the bus stop. At times I would see someone with just half a loaf. The prices hit families hard but they adjusted to it, and the boy's parents must have made savings here and there to be able to buy two loaves a day. Perhaps the pater familias was no longer using the bus to go to Harare. Perhaps he had repaired his old bicycle and was now cycling to work - a saving of 60 Zimbabwe dollars a day. ""So you are leaving the country then?"" he said to me without greeting. He looked down in the dumps. I said I was not sure what he meant. ""I know they have bombed your printing press. You must leave the country. Last year, they bombed your offices. This year they've bombed your printing press. Next year they'll bomb you. Go, like everybody else - either to America, the UK, anywhere. As I will, when I grow up."" Yes, there is an exodus. Ever since Robert Mugabe unleashed the war veterans on the Movement for Democratic Change and the white commercial farmers, there has been so much violence against any group opposing the government that many people feel trapped. The Daily News editorial offices are located on the fifth floor of Trustee House. Last year a bomb exploded in a art gallery on the ground floor, directly below the office of the editor-in-chief, Geoff Nyarota. To this day there have been no arrests. A swarm of police and army bomb disposal experts were at the bombed-out site of the printing press on Sunday. They were poking at this, peering at that, with a diligence that Chief Inspector Morse would have admired. Many of us were not impressed. This was a political crime and the police had recently become so political we suspect they take their orders only from the politicians never mind the evidence. Augustin Shihuri, the police commissioner, himself a war veteran, had declared pub licly that he was a Zanu PF member and wanted every officer to be a party member. Others could wait until their party came to power, he said. The previous week the Daily News had been bombarded by both the war veterans, hired to frighten the daylights out of the voters during an election, and Jonathan Moyo, minister of state for information and publicity in Mugabe's office, whose assignment seems to be to put the fear of God into every journalist in the country. He as much as said our days were numbered - we had become a national security risk he said, among other amazing accusations. We were linked to the MDC, to the commercial farmers and to the British and the Americans. We had to go. The Daily News managed to publish a 12-page issue on Monday, instead of its usual 82 pages - and has published more pages since then, with the generous help of another independent publishing house in Harare. Of the bombing, the government said it was to be regretted. The war veterans said they had played no part in it at all. Meanwhile, there were many sympathetic telephone calls to our offices. We should soldier on, they said; they needed us and if we needed help from them, all we had to do was to spell it out. What about a public fund for the purchase of a new printing press? We said we would consider all suggestions seriously. I won't be going anywhere for a long time. We might even persuade the 10-year-old to stay on in the country - assuming Mugabe and the war veterans don't blow up the country before he turns 19. • Bill Saidi is deputy editor of the Daily News",2001-01-31T02:59:04Z,"{'polarity': 0.029835858585858584, 'subjectivity': 0.30200577200577194}",0.30200577200577194
world/2001/jun/07/mcveigh.usa,McVeigh loses death appeal,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/07/mcveigh.usa,"Timothy McVeigh is scheduled to die on Monday, after a Denver judge turned down his appeal for a delay, ruling there was no doubt over his guilt for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the worst terrorist attack in US history. McVeigh's lawyers immediately declared their intention to appeal against Judge Richard Matsch's decision. They had claimed that the belated discovery of thousands of pages of documents from the FBI investigation necessitated a stay of execution for further study. However, Judge Matsch said the newly unearthed documents represented only a tiny part of the huge body of evidence amassed by the FBI and there was nothing in them to cast doubt on the finding that McVeigh detonated a huge bomb in a rented lorry outside a government building on April 19 1995, killing 168 people. The judge described as ""just not tenable"" the defence claim that the jury in McVeigh's 1997 trial might not have imposed a death sentence if they had seen the new documents. The federal prosecutor, Sean Connelly, made a brief statement after yesterday's hearing, saying the government was ""gratified"" by the ruling. The US attorney general, John Ashcroft, who had postponed the execution from May 16 to June 11 after the documents were discovered, said it was ""a ruling for justice"". ""We've never had a doubt about the guilt about Timothy McVeigh,"" Mr Ashcroft said. ""But it seemed to me that we needed more than a guilty defendant, we needed an innocent system _ and today I believe that the ruling of the court makes it clear that we not only have a guilty defendant but we have a system which is fair and innocent."" McVeigh has admitted carrying out the bombing. But his defence team argued that the new evidence added weight to the belief that other, unknown, conspirators were involved in the attack, which might have had a bearing on his death sentence. But Judge Matsch said: ""Whatever may in time be discovered about the possible involvement of others does not change the fact that Timothy McVeigh was the instrument of death and destruction."" He could not accept the defence argument that McVeigh claimed to have acted alone only to protect his co-conspirators. Robert Nigh, one of McVeigh's lawyers, said he was disappointed by the judgment, but his team would appeal to the 10th circuit court of appeals, which has a record of upholding Richard Matsch's rulings. If the appeal for a stay is turned down there, it could go to the supreme court if McVeigh chooses to pursue it. In Oklahoma City, most survivors and relatives of the victims welcomed the ruling. Doris Jones, whose daughter and unborn grandchild were killed in the blast, said: ""I'm ready for this to be over with. It's been six years and we need to have this behind us."" If further appeals are turned down, McVeigh, 33, will be executed by injection at 7am on Monday.",2001-06-07T08:08:53Z,"{'polarity': 0.006588613406795208, 'subjectivity': 0.6067263544536271}",0.6067263544536271
world/2001/jun/25/worlddispatch.annemcilroy,Racist remarks jeopardise Toronto Olympic bid,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/25/worlddispatch.annemcilroy,"The loud-mouthed mayor of Toronto may have cost Canada's largest city the chance to host the 2008 summer Olympic Games with an ill-timed and racist remark about his fear of going to Africa in case of ""natives"" boiling him in a pot. ""Why the hell would I want to go to a place like Mombassa?"" Mayor Mel Lastman said to a freelance journalist before leaving for a trip to Kenya to pitch the Toronto Olympic bid. "" I just see myself in a pot of boiling water with all these natives dancing around me."" Mr Lastman is now in far more danger of being boiled alive by the Toronto bid committee, which has worked hard to win the 2008 games against tough competition from Beijing - seen by many as the frontrunner - and Paris. In Paris, at least one sports official was publicly gloating about Mr Lastman's blunder, which comes less than a month before International Olympic Committee members vote on which city will get the games. Alain Mouchel, head of the French Olympic Mission, said the mayor had knocked Toronto out of contention. The IOC first vice-president, Anita DeFrantz, an African American running to be IOC president, said the remarks are no joke, and are a sign of how the Toronto mayor thinks. But another IOC member, Kip Keino, played down their importance. He said they reflect only on Mr Lastman, not on the city of Toronto, Canada's most multicultural city. There are 121 voting members of the IOC, 15 of them from Africa. If the vote is as close as some are predicting, Toronto will need some of those African votes to have any hope of overtaking Beijing. Mr Lastman actually made his remarks two weeks ago, but they were only published in the sports pages of a Toronto daily last week. It quickly became front-page news, with one columnist dubbing the mayor a ""tiny tanned time bomb"" with a world view ""shaped in equal parts by Tarzan movies and Bugs Bunny cartoons."" There were calls for his resignation. Even the Canadian prime minister waded into the controversy. Jean Chretien, travelling in Sweden, said Mr Lastman's comments could hurt Canada's chances of hosting the games. Mr Lastman is known for frank outbursts. He once threatened to kill a reporter, and he says that when running for mayor in 1997, the only thing he feared was his own mouth. Late last week, he held a press conference where he refused to answer questions about why he was worried African cannibals would make soup out of him, but repeated the same wooden apology more than 20 times. ""I am truly sorry I made the remarks. My comments were inappropriate."" Bob Richardson, head of Toronto's bid committee, moved quickly into damage control mode. ""The number one thing we'd like to say on behalf of the Toronto Olympic bid is that firstly, we accept the mayor's apology. ""We felt his remarks were inappropriate. However, it is a new day today. We want to move forward and we think it is time to turn the page."" The IOC will make its decision on July 13 in Moscow.

world/2001/jan/11/israel,Ten targets of Israeli campaign,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/11/israel,"1 Hussein Abayat, 33, father of six. Killed on November 9 at Beit Sahour, West Bank. Abayat, the first victim of the ""initiated attacks"", was a baker by day and said by Israeli army to be a senior ""terrorist"" and a merchant of illegal weapons. He was was killed by missiles fired from Israeli helicopter gunships on a street in Bethlehem. Two Palestinian women nearby were killed, and nine others injured. Israel admitted the killing within hours. ""We hit somebody very senior. We will hit anyone who tries to hit us,"" an Israeli general said. 2 Jamal Abdel-Razak, 30. Killed on November 22 at Morag junction in the Gaza Strip. Abdel-Razak, a well-known Fatah activist during the first intifada, was travelling in a friend's car to college at Khan Yunis when he was ambushed by soldiers. Abdel-Razak's head was blown off in the resulting fire, which also killed the driver of his car, and two other Palestinian men in a nearby taxi. The Israeli army claimed that it had killed four members of a Fatah cell, who had opened fire to avoid arrest. 3 Ibrahim Bani Odeh, 34, father of five. Killed on November 23 in Nablus. Odeh, a leader of the military wing of Hamas, was killed a day after his release from jail, by a bomb planted in the headrest of the car he was driving, detonated by remote control from an Israeli military helicopter, according to the Palestinian governor of Nablus. Israeli military officials said he was killed in a ""work accident"" - code for deaths caused when assembling bombs. 4 Mahmoud al-Mughrabi, 24. Killed on December 11 at Beit Jala, a suburb of Bethlehem. Mughrabi was shot in the head and chest by an Israeli undercover unit operating on a bypass road . Witnesses said he was in the area to plant a bomb on the tunnel road leading from the Jewish settlement of Gilo when they were caught by an Israeli patrol. Mugrabi's comrades fled, but he was shot in the leg. A few minutes later, they heard three gunshots. 5 Anwar Hamran, 28, father of one. Killed on December 11 in Nablus Hamran, a leader in the military wing of Islamic Jihad, had just stepped out of his bookshop when he was attacked by Israeli forces opening fire from Mount Gerizim, which overlooks Nablus. Doctors said his body was riddled with 19 bullets. Witnesses said Hamran was unarmed and the shooting continued long after he fell to the ground. The Israeli army said he was armed, and they were returning fire. 6 Yusuf Abu Swayeh, 28, father of one. Killed on December 12 at al-Khader village, near Bethlehem. Abu Swayeh, a well-known Fatah activist, was ambushed by a white Subaru with Israeli licence plates. Four men from Israel's elite Kingfisher undercover unit opened fire, and were backed up by machine-gun fire from a nearby Israeli army checkpoint. Palestinian newspapers said he had 17 separate bullet wounds. 7 Abbas al-Ewiwi, 26. Killed on December 13 at Hebron Ewiwi, a member of the military wing of Hamas who had served five years in an Israeli jail, was shot dead moments after leaving the family's shoe repair shop to visit a neighbour. Doctors said he had been hit by three high-velocity bullets, suggesting he was targeted by snipers. Palestinian witnesses said there was no shooting in the area at the time. The Israeli army said Ewiwi had been armed with a pistol. 8 Hani Abu Bakra, 31, father of three. Killed on December 14 at Deir al-Balah in the Gaza Strip A taxi driver and a student at the Islamic University in Gaza City who was suspected of belonging to the military wing of Hamas, Abu Bakra was going to town with six passengers when he was stopped at an Israeli military checkpoint. Soldiers ordered a woman out of the car, then opened fire with automatic rifles and from a tank. Abu Bakra took more than 20 bullets. Israeli newspapers said the operation was carried out by an anti-terror police unit. 9 Samih Maliabi, 25, father of two. Killed on December 17 at Kalandia refugee camp, near Ramallah. A Fatah activist, Maliabi was killed by a bomb in an isolated area of the camp. According to some reports, he was killed by a booby-trapped mobile phone - mirroring the way Israeli agents killed a leading Palestinian bombmaker known as the engineer in 1996. Fatah says Maliabi was blown up by the Israeli security services. Israeli security officials say he was killed in a ""work accident"". 10 Thabet Thabet, 50, father of three. Killed on December 31 at Tulkaram. The most controversial of Israel's assassinations. Thabet had links with Israeli peace activists stretching back 12 years. He was cut down by M-16 rifle fire from an Israeli car. Doctors said he was shot 15 times in the upper body.

world/2001/apr/18/israel2,Israeli government profiled,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/18/israel2,"The Israeli government coalition led by Ariel Sharon was always going to be strained by the presence of Shimon Peres, a liberal and architect of the Oslo peace agreement. The strain began to tell yesterday as the Israeli army occupied Palestinian territory, breaching the agreement signed by Mr Peres, a member of the Labour party. Mr Peres is the respectable face of the coalition. One of his parliamentary colleagues in the Labour party, who is critical of his presence in the coaltion, said Mr Peres felt he could be a moderating influence: ""He thinks he can prevent silly decisions."" But Mr Peres, the foreign minister, does not appear to be having much success. Two weeks ago Mr Sharon gave the go-ahead for a 700-house expansion of a Jewish settlement in the West Bank just as Mr Peres was boasting that part of the price for going into the coaliton was that there would be no new settlements. Semantically, Mr Sharon could argue that the expansion of an existing settlement is different from creating a new one: the distinction was lost on the Palestinians. Yesterday, Mr Peres was forced to defend the Israeli occupation of part of Palestinian-controlled Gaza that goes against the Oslo agreement that is his crowning glory. Only two weeks ago, in an interview with the Guardian, Mr Peres claimed that part of the price for going into a coalition with Mr Sharon was that the government would respect international agreements. The re-occupation of parts of Gaza would appear to run counter to that. Mr Peres has been trying to square the circle. He said that in the end there will have to be a diplomatic solution: ""Obviously when there's a need to defend, defend. But these problems cannot be solved with force.""

world/2001/may/20/september11.usa,Britons hold key to master terrorist trial,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/20/september11.usa,"It is a book 18 chapters long with 180 pages. It was found in a nondescript terrace house in Manchester last May. It is turning out to be the key piece of evidence in the trial of the alleged master terrorist Osama bin Laden. The title of the work, roughly translated from Arabic, is Military Studies in the Holy War Against Tyrants. It is a 'how to' guidebook to any budding international terrorist. The United States government says it binds four young men, now on trial for bomb attacks on its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998 in which 224 people died, into a fanatical global conspiracy to kill US citizens. The defence says the book does nothing of the sort. Next week the jury will make their choice. The trial has been running in New York for nearly three months. Much of the most crucial evidence has come from Britain. The court has heard testimony alleging that: dozens of telephone calls were made to bin Laden operatives from addresses in London; claims for responsibility for the embassy attacks were faxed to a machine in the capital; essential equipment was purchased in the UK; and crucial personnel lived in British cities. The jury, which spent five days deliberating last week, asked for the manual, found by British police, to be shown to them once more. Every day proceedings are typed up and filed.The head of each transcript bears the legend: The United States of America vs bin Laden. The importance of the events in Room 318 of the Southern District court of New York is not lost on anyone, particularly British intelligence services who are watching carefully. 'The Americans cannot afford to lose this one. They have spent three years and billions of dollars on this. If they can't get a conviction here they are never going to be able to,' one British security expert told The Observer . Bin Laden himself is no where near the courtroom. The 44-year-old Saudi-born extremist is in Afghanistan, constantly moving between three bases in the mountains and deserts in the east and south of the country. The Americans want him badly. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has offered a $5million reward for information resulting in his arrest. A series of assassination or kidnapping plans have been considered and rejected. Missile strikes against so-called 'terrorist training camps' in Afghanistan in the aftermath of the embassy bombings - never officially claimed by bin Laden - did little other than to turn him into a hero for alienated Islamic youth worldwide. Instead the threat he, his organisation, and 'militant Islam' are believed to pose has been condensed into the less than impressive forms of the four men whose fate 12 jurors will decide in the coming days. With their thin, straggling beards and quiet eyes they don't look like representatives of the 'most immediate threat to America's national security', as CIA director George Tenet recently claimed. Two face life imprisonment. The other two - Mohammed Rashed Daoud al-Owhali, 24, and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27 - face the death penalty. During the three-month trial the court has heard witnesses describe bin Laden's operations. The court heard how bin Laden, who is the son of a multi-millionaire Saudi Arabian contractor, is alleged to have made his name using his share of his family's fortune to support the Afghan Mujahideen in their war against the Russians. By the early Nineties he was in Sudan sheltered by its extremist Islamic regime. A key witness is Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl, a 37-year-old Sudanese national who claims to be a former bin Laden operative. Giving evidence, he drew a picture of life in bin Laden's organisation, when it was based in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. He joined bin Laden's al-Qaeda, which roughly translates as 'The Base', in Afghanistan and claims he was soon a trusted employee delivering $100,000 in cash to an al-Qaeda member in Jordan and organising the purchase of 50 camels to run weapons through Egypt. But al-Fadl fell out with bin Laden over money and approached the Americans to save his family from al-Qaeda's vengeance. A host of witnesses, hundreds of kilogrammes of evidence and thousands of maps, pictures and diagrams - many displayed on special plasma screens in the heavily guarded courtroom - have detailed the alleged events of the day of the bomb attacks. But the problem for the prosecution has been to show that the four men on trial were committed followers of bin Laden and were acting on his orders. If they fail, then the claims Western intelligence agencies make about the 'master terrorist's' global reach and unrivalled and unprecedented power to attack the West begin to look decidedly thin. Perhaps the strongest allegation linking bin Laden to the attacks is from Ali Mohamed, a former US army sergeant and admitted terrorist conspirator, who said he had seen bin Laden look at a photograph of the US em-bassy in Nairobi and point out to followers where a sui cide bomber might attack. But Ali Mohamed has never been called to the stand, leaving prosecutors to rely on evidence gathered in London. They claim that a Saudi dissident, Khalid al-Fawwaz, who has been living in Britain since 1994, ran bin Laden's propaganda operation from the UK and even bought a satellite phone for al-Qaeda. Akhtar Raja, lawyer for al-Fawwaz, said last week that his client was innocent: 'The [American] evidence is tenuous at best. As a legitimate asylum-seeker, al-Fawwaz was engaging in perfectly normal activities. He has no connection to bin Laden and is against violence.' Al-Fawwaz is currently fighting American attempts to extradite him. The New York court has heard how British phone records show that faxes in which responsibility for the East African attacks was claimed were sent from Baku in Azerbaijan to a public fax office in north London called The Grapevine. The faxes were sent from a number which had received, shortly before, a series of calls from satellite phones that the FBI says have been established as belonging to bin Laden. The faxes were picked up from The Grapevine by two Egyptians who are still sought by police. Observers have recognised that, so far, the bulk of the evidence for bin Laden's involvement in the East African attacks is merely circumstantial. The terrorist manual found in Manchester relies on obscure references to 'The Base' to prove its supposed provenance. No one seems entirely sure how it is linked to the men on trial. Al-Fadl's testimony in particular is seen as unreliable. Security sources in the Middle East say that other nations' agencies refused his aid before the Americans offered him large sums if he testified. Many are watching the trial in Jordan of another alleged bin Laden operative - Raed Hijazi. He has been charged with conspiring to blow up hotels in Amman packed with tourists on millennium eve. He denies the crime or any link to bin Laden. His lawyer told The Observer that his confession that he had pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda while in Afghanistan in 1999 was beaten out of him. So doubts about the reality of bin Laden's capacity to wreak global havoc grow. 'I just don't buy the theory that he is sitting in a cave somewhere organising global terror,' said one Western intelligence analyst. 'The Americans can't cope without a clear target. So they have created one. 'And in doing so they are playing right into bin Laden's hands.' jason.burke@observer.co.uk",2001-05-20T15:31:12Z,"{'polarity': 0.04674432710146997, 'subjectivity': 0.3535337678194821}",0.3535337678194821
world/2001/jun/01/mcveigh.usa,McVeigh appeals for stay of execution,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/01/mcveigh.usa,"Eleven days before he was due to face lethal injection, Timothy McVeigh yesterday appealed for a stay of execution on the grounds that the FBI had withheld vital evidence about its investigation into the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. McVeigh's lawyers, Robert Nigh and Richard Burr, claimed they had evidence that the FBI had committed a ""fraud on the court"" and was still holding back documents about the investigation,which could point to the involvement of other people in the bomb attack, which killed 168 people. The attorney general, John Ashcroft, has said he would fight any attempt to obtain a postponement arguing that none of the new documents, belatedly handed over in the past month by the FBI, cast any doubt on Mr McVeigh's guilt. He has also denied that the government deliberately withheld evidence. The decision over whether to delay the execution will be taken in the next few days by a Denver judge, Richard Matsch, who presided over McVeigh's trial in 1997. McVeigh had previously waived his rights to appeal against his death sentence and told journalists he had acted alone in detonating a lorry packed with explosives outside a government building. However, his lawyers said he felt a delay was necessary ""to promote the integrity of the criminal justice system"". ""This decision was not easy for Mr McVeigh. He was prepared to die,"" Mr Nigh said. ""He had previously indicated that he preferred death to life in prison without the possibility of release. It is upon principle that Mr McVeigh has decided to seek court relief and it's based upon the government's failure to produce evidence in his case."" Mr Burr said the new documents and research by the defence team would prove that the FBI was still withholding information about other suspects in the bombing. He said: ""It is quite clear to us that people have been investigated carefully by the FBI and they have never produced a single piece of paper about these people."" Along with a 40-page appeal for a stay of execution, Mr Burr said defence lawyers would submit a demand for a hearing on the FBI's behaviour. ""The papers we file today will be arguing to Judge Matsch that a fraud upon the court has been committed by the federal government in withholding massive numbers of documents from the defence and continuing to withhold numbers of documents from the defence."" If fraud was proved, Mr Burr said, the court's verdict should be declared void. Last month, just days before McVeigh's original May 16 execution date, Mr Ashcroft granted a month's delay after the FBI unearthed thousands of pages of evidence from the bombing investigation, which should have been made available to the defence team before his trial. However, Mr Ashcroft said that nothing in the documents would have changed the guilty verdict and the death sentence. In a statement issued before yesterday's appeal, he argued: ""Because these documents cast no doubt on the surety of his guilt, the justice department will vigorously oppose any attempt to further delay the imposition of the sentence.""",2001-06-01T00:34:48Z,"{'polarity': -0.05947742733457019, 'subjectivity': 0.41660868893011743}",0.41660868893011743
world/2001/feb/14/israel,Israel kills Arafat's man,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/14/israel,"The Israeli army struck at the heart of Yasser Arafat's administration by assassinating an officer in his personal security guard yesterday, fuelling the escalation of violence that began with the election of the hardliner Ariel Sharon as the Jewish state's prime minister. Massoud Ayad, 54, a lieutenant colonel in Mr Arafat's Force 17 elite body guard, was killed by a volley of rockets fired from two helicopters that had been tracking his white Honda Civic along a main road in the Jabaliya refugee camp, north of Gaza City. The car was reduced to a smouldering wreck, and four bystanders were injured. Ayad joins more than 20 victims of Israel's official policy of assassinating Palestinians it accuses of attacks on soldiers and civilians. But never before has Israel struck so deeply into Mr Arafat's administration. All of the operations were sanctioned by the outgoing prime minister, Ehud Barak, who yesterday sent ""heartfelt congratulations"" to the army for killing Ayad. The murder of Ayad - and the death of a Palestinian teenager shot through the heart by an Israeli sniper in the Gaza Strip yesterday - came as Mr Sharon was finalising a deal for a national unity government with Mr Barak's Labour party. Mr Barak said Israel would continue picking off Palestinian leaders. ""It is a clear message to those who plan to attack Israelis, that they will not get away with it. The long arm of the Israel defence forces will call them to account,"" he said. The Palestinian Authority said Israel was guilty of war crimes. ""Israel is a state above the law,"" the justice minister, Freih Abu Medein, declared. Ayad was the first Palestinian official to be assassinated since December 31, when a middle-aged dentist and a leader of Mr Arafat's Fatah movement, Thabet Thabet, was sprayed with machine-gun fire in a mafia-style hit in the West Bank city of Tulkarm. Thabet had been closely associated with several Israeli peace activists since the late 1980s and his death sparked international outrage. The Israeli army yesterday called a press conference to list a series of operations Ayad allegedly conducted on behalf of Hizbullah, the Shia Muslim organisation which led Lebanese resistance to Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon. A spokesman, Brigadier Ron Kitrey, said Ayad had been responsible for several attacks on Israeli soldiers and settlers in the Gaza Strip since December 24 last year. They included firing a home-made mortar bomb which damaged the roof of a house in the Jewish settlement of Netzarim on January 29, and a second mortar attack on the enclave on February 10, in which the bomb fell in an open area. He accused him of planning to kidnap Israeli troops, and of drug smuggling. ""We had no choice but to exclude him from the list of salaries in Hizbullah,"" he said. Palestinian analysts, however, said that it was highly unlikely that Mr Arafat would have tolerated the infiltration of his personal protection unit by a man with dual loyalties to his administration, as well as to Hizbullah. ""Nothing they say can legitimise this act - period,"" said Raji Sourani, director of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights in Gaza. ""This is illegal, this is unprovoked, this is a crime, this is against international standards."" As news of Ayad's death spread through Gaza, hundreds of people gathered around the wreck of his car, chanting ""Death to Israel"". A steady stream of mourners filed past his corpse in Gaza's Shifa hospital. Ayad was well-known in Gaza, and his job was a reward for 30 years as an activist in the Fatah movement, during which he did several stints in Israeli jails. Unlike 80% of res idents in the territory, he was a local man and not a refugee. His burial today is bound to ratchet up the violence still further. But his killing will also sow terror and suspicion in Palestinian areas. ""All the Palestinian people now are worried about spies, not just in the Palestinian Authority, but in our families and among the people who can give information about anyone,"" Ayad's nephew, Motasem Ayad, said. In Bethlehem and Ramallah, the leaders of Fatah militias have taken to changing their hideouts every night.",2001-02-14T02:32:53Z,"{'polarity': -0.029901960784313723, 'subjectivity': 0.27107843137254894}",0.27107843137254894
world/2001/jun/13/worlddispatch.julianborger,World dispatch: US executions after McVeigh,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/13/worlddispatch.julianborger,"The business leaders of Terre Haute have proudly named their town the ""Crossroads of America"". The Chamber of Commerce has worked out that the average distance from its factories to its markets is the smallest in the nation. In other words, it lies at the country's very heart. Its centrality has not been always a blessing. Al Capone and John Dillinger used to hide from the Chicago police here, and run a thriving trade in bootleg alcohol along the Wabash River. Now its geography has won it another unenviable distinction - the official execution capital of the nation. Two years ago, the government built a ""death house"" at the Terre Haute federal penitentiary, complete with a chamber for lethal injections, and witness rooms around it. The death house has been in the news this week, of course, because it is where Timothy McVeigh was killed, six years after he murdered 168 people with a bomb planted outside an Oklahoma City government building in April 1995. However, McVeigh's case was unique. He was responsible for the worst act of terrorism by an American in US history. Moreover, he, along with four out of every five of his countrymen, wanted the execution to go ahead. It was the first execution of a federal prisoner in 38 years, but it may be the next one, scheduled for next Tuesday, that will turn out to be even more important for the future of capital punishment in the US. Juan Raul Garza is due to be executed for murder and drug-smuggling - a heinous crime to be sure, but not on the same awesome scale as McVeigh's mass killing. Unlike McVeigh, Garza has shown remorse and does not want to die. McVeigh was one of only three white inmates on death row. Garza, a Hispanic Texan, is more typical of death rows around the country, packed with minorities. The point is that if Garza is put to death, federal executions, in abeyance since 1963, would once more become normal. The individual states have imposed hundreds of death sentences since a four-year moratorium was lifted in 1976, but this would mark the seal of approval of the federal government itself - an important distinction. As one criminologist, James Alan Fox of Northeastern University put it: ""The ice is broken."" Last year, President Clinton postponed Garza's execution after the justice department found evidence to suggest that race and geography played a part in sentencing in federal cases. However, President Bush's attourney general, John Ashcroft announced just before McVeigh's execution that despite the fact that only 2 of the 19 remaining inmates on federal death row are white, there was ""no evidence of bias against racial or ethnic minorities."" It is a conclusion challenged by human rights activists who question Ashcroft's use of statistics, but for the time being the ruling has removed the brakes from the execution locomotive. Federal executions will now pick up speed, and the little brick ""death house"" in Terre Haute will become a familiar sight.

world/2001/may/23/israel1,Sharon rejects call for freeze on settlements,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/23/israel1,"Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, deflated hopes last night that a US report could serve as a first step to ending eight months of bloodshed in the Middle East by rejecting one of its main conditions. In a televised news conference, Mr Sharon said Israel would not heed one of the central recommendations of the report by the respected peacemaker and former US senator, George Mitchell: that there should be an immediate freeze on illegal Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. However, he responded positively to the recommendation for an end to violence by both Israel and the Palestinians, by calling for a ceasefire. ""The government regards settlements in all their forms as a vital national enterprise,"" Mr Sharon said. He addressed the highly sensitive issue only after being questioned by a reporter. He said the government would not found new settlements in addition to the 145 Jewish outposts that dot the hills of the West Bank and the sand dunes of Gaza, but added that ""the government will provide for ongoing requirements of the development of existing settlements"". A leading Palestinian official expressed anger last night at Mr Sharon's intransigence. ""Settlements are illegal and they were built under the occupation forces in Palestinian territory,"" said Ahmed Abdel Rahman, general secretary of the Palestinian Authority. ""The Palestinian people will resist the settlement occupation because settlement activity is a time bomb that will destroy the peace process. ""Unless the Palestinians hear an obvious word to remove the occupation and the settlements, the Palestinians have no choice but to continue the resistance through this intifada."" Mr Sharon's refusal to give any ground on the notion of ""natural growth"" of the Jewish settlements - or new constructions within the exceedingly generous existing boundaries - seriously undermines any prospect that the Mitchell report can serve as a blueprint peace agreement, analysts said. Instead, Mr Sharon sought last night to defer the question of settlements. ""When the terrorism stops, when there has been a proper cooling-off period as proposed by the Mitchell report, we shall most certainly be prepared to hold discussions with the Palestinian Authority,"" he said, but added: ""As long as they behave like a terrorist organisation I think we have to behave as we do to a terrorist organisation."" Yesterday, the Middle East envoys of the United Nations and European Union backed the Mitchell committee's call for a halt to settlements. That pressure could grow amid evidence that Mr Sharon's pledge not to build settlements is a hollow one - a Peace Now survey found 15 new outposts in the West Bank had been built since his election last February, at distances of up to 700 metres from existing settlements. Washington continued its re-engagement in Middle East peacemaking yesterday. The US ambassador to Tel Aviv, Martin Indyk, met Mr Sharon to discuss the Mitchell report. He reportedly told the envoy that he wanted a cooling-off period of at least two months before he implements the confidence-building measures recommended by the report.",2001-05-23T00:44:28Z,"{'polarity': -0.015722703222703218, 'subjectivity': 0.29668109668109666}",0.29668109668109666

world/2001/jun/11/israel,Israeli shell kills Bedouin women,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/11/israel,"The Middle East ceasefire was in the balance yesterday after Israeli tank fire killed three Palestinian women in a Bedouin tent on the Gaza Strip. The killings came as Israeli and Palestinian officials prepared to meet the CIA chief George Tenet to discuss ways of stabilising the ceasefire. In a move apparently calculated to influence the talks, Israel announced the arrest of six Palestinians said to have carried out bombings in Israeli cities, but did not say when the arrests took place. Palestinian sources said the women died when a shell hit their tent near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim. Their deaths were the first since the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, joined Israel's call for a ceasefire nine days ago. The Israeli army said tanks fired three shells at ""two armed Palestinians on open ground"" after Israeli military posts near the settlement came under attack around midnight on Saturday. ""Contrary to Palestinian claims, the force returned fire only towards the source of the shooting,"" a spokesman said. But Mohammed al-Rash, a villager living near the tent, told Reuters: ""We were surprised by the tank fire because we had not heard shooting."" The dead women, Selmiya al-Malalha, Hekmat al-Malalha, and Nasra al-Malalha, were members of the same family. At least two other relatives were injured, one seriously. The Palestinian information minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo, called on Israel to condemn the killings. He said: ""We also ask the US government to condemn this crime, not only because it is a violation of the ceasefire, but because it is a shameful act committed by the Israeli army who, even after destroying Palestinians' homes in Gaza and turning them into refugees, is also continuing shelling their tents and murdering the women inside."" At the women's funeral yesterday afternoon there were cries of ""No to talks, yes to continuing the intifada"" from the crowd of about 1,000. Meanwhile, a statement from the office of the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, said security forces had recently arrested ""a military unit"" which included members of Mr Arafat's Fatah organisation. The group carried out six bomb attacks in three Israeli cities and a West Bank settlement in April, the statement said. One person was seriously hurt in one attack. Six members of the cell were arrested and one was killed while evading capture, it added. A Palestinian security official said the dead man, Adnan Assad Said Odeh, was killed by Israeli forces on April 30 - before the ceasefire started. Palestinian officials avoided suggesting the women's deaths marked the end of the ceasefire, but said they made it more difficult to win backing for Mr Arafat's call to halt the violence. The Palestinians were expected to raise the issue at a meeting with Mr Tenet, who has been awaiting responses from both sides to his plan for consolidating the ceasefire. The key points of Mr Tenet's plan are that the Palestinian Authority: arrest ""terrorists"" known to both sides; refrain from inciting violence and supporting attacks on Israeli settlements; prevent people leaving areas under its control to attack Israel and not to provide refuge for them after attacks; confiscate weapons in areas under their control. Israel must: withdraw forces to their positions immediately before the outbreak of the intifada on September 28 2000, ending the closures of Palestinian areas; stop its forces from entering Palestinian-controlled areas and attacking Palestinians; and attempt to restrain attacks by settlers.

The assault was retaliation for a mortar attack on Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip. It was the first time that Israeli troops had entered Palestinian controlled territory since the outbreak of fighting. Residents of the Khan Yunis refugee camp said the attack began when tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers advanced as helicopters hovered above. Shells were fired at the camp, drawing return fire. The army said Palestinians also fired more mortars at nearby Jewish settlements. ""We started running from our homes ... while they were firing toward us and bulldozers started destroying our homes without giving us a warning,"" said Imad Abu Namous, a father of seven who lost his home in the assault. By daybreak, hundreds of camp residents were sifting through the rubble. One man tried to retrieve a ceiling fan still linked by an electric wire to the remains of the ceiling. A policeman and a civilian died from shrapnel injuries and 27 people were wounded. Palestinian officials complained that Israel had re-entered areas under full Palestinian control. Israel troops withdrew from two thirds of Gaza in 1994, as part of interim peace agreements. However, the Israeli defence minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, said his country had no interest in reoccupying Palestinian territory. He said troops attacked an area from which mortar shells were repeatedly fired at Jewish settlements. ""The order was to go in and destroy the same posts from which our communities were shelled. These are points we don't want the Palestinians to return to,"" he told Israeli radio. Tel Aviv says the Palestinians have fired more than 50 mortar shells at Jewish settlements in recent days.

world/2001/apr/27/israel1,"West Bank sees battle, as officials meet",World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/27/israel1,"Israeli troops rocketed a Palestinian office building and fought a heavy battle with Palestinian gunmen today, just hours after high-ranking security officials from both sides held talks on how to work together in trying to prevent violence. Several Israeli jeeps entered Palestinian territory, witnesses said. Three Palestinians and an Israeli soldier were wounded in the exchange of fire north of the West Bank town of Ramallah, witnesses and doctors said. But the Israeli army said that no soldiers were hurt. Earlier in the day, Israeli and Palestinian security officials had held security talks. A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that he believed that the meeting could pave the way for a resumption of security co-ordination, one of the pillars of interim peace agreements. Israel has said such co-ordination and a complete cessation of violence are a prerequisite for renewing peace talks. The initiative calls for a cease-fire and an Israeli freeze on settlement construction, followed by a resumption of talks on a final peace deal. Israel wants better guarantees that Palestinians will cease attacks and has said that it will not agree to stop all settlement construction. In Jerusalem, the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, and his foreign minister, Shimon Peres, discussed Israel's response to an Egyptian-Jordanian peace proposal. Mr Sharon has said that he wants to negotiate a long-term interim agreement, not a full peace treaty. Mr Peres is to fly to Cairo on Sunday to explain Israel's reservations about the plan, then head to Washington for talks with the US secretary of state, Colin Powell. In an interview with army radio on Israel's independence day yesterday, Mr Sharon said that, ""after examining the plan, it is clear to me that there must be changes, substantial changes in it."" Today's clashes began after Muslim noon prayers when about 2,000 Palestinians marched to an Israeli army position north of Ramallah. At one point, Palestinian gunmen opened fire at Israeli troops, and a firefight ensued. Among those wounded was a Palestinian security official, who was hit in the chest. When the fighting intensified, Israel fired seven rockets at the Palestinian bureau of statistics, located in Palestinian territory, witnesses said. The missiles heavily damaged the facade, and three Israeli jeeps were seen in the area. In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, a bomb exploded near a Jewish settlement, wounding an Israeli civilian and a soldier, the army said.

world/2001/apr/16/michaelellison1,"After 38 years, race trial gives city chance for justice",World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/16/michaelellison1,"Three preachers take turns to beat out a strident message devoted to a loving and forgiving saviour, a member of the sparse congregation for the Easter service punctuating their words with an occasional ""amen"" or a ""yes"". On the face of it there is nothing to separate the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church from dozens of others. The denomination's churches run to more than four pages in the Birmingham telephone book. Down in the basement, though, among black and white photographs of the church's former pastors, old banners and a model of the slave ship Spirit of Amistad is the artefact resting on beige and white linoleum tiles that makes Sixteenth Street different. It is a timepiece, made by the Radio Advertising Clock Co, with its hands forever at 10.22, the red seconds indicator at 43 seconds, the time when the electricity supply failed. This was the place and this the time at which a bomb made out of 19 sticks of dynamite exploded on September 15, 1963: when the rubble had settled and the dust cleared enough for anyone to tell, four Sunday school girls in their best white dresses and black patent leather shoes were dead. Today, nearly 38 years later, that clock in a sense starts to tick again on one of the deadliest events of the sixties civil rights struggle, when 62-year-old Thomas Blanton finally goes on trial accused of murdering the girls, one aged 11, the others 14. No one was charged then, even though a FBI report named the likely killers, because witnesses were scared to testify and it was thought unlikely that any jury would convict. ""No one believed that a local jury would return any kind of guilty verdict, so things just sat for a while,"" says Robert Langford, the retired FBI supervisor who reopened the case in 1994 after talking to black leaders. Blanton would have been joined in the dock by another former member of the Ku Klux Klan had not the court ruled last week that 71-year-old Bobby Frank Cherry is mentally and physically unfit to stand trial, at least for the time being. ""It's a good time, a very opportune time to become mentally incapable,"" says Sixteenth Street's assistant pastor, the Reverend Joseph Decatur, standing beside the door that leads to the room where the girls died. ""I think it will give people closure if they can bring it to a conclusion but now that the men are not being tried together, that's going to prolong the issue. These men have been allowed to grow old and even if they are convicted they won't have long to serve because they're going to die soon. ""I really think it would be a travesty if they were found not guilty. People would be very upset and would express that vociferously but I don't think there would be any violence. Black people realise that they've come so far that they will never go back."" Some black people, certainly. The church is part of a complex known as the civil rights historic district and Birmingham promotes its constituent parts on the guide to the city's attractions in precisely the way it does the vintage motor sports museum, Visionland amusement park (the newest in the South) and the zoo. Across the street from the church is the Civil Rights Institute, whose mission is to follow the path of the city's part in the movement to have black people treated as equals. Opposite the institute is Kelly Ingram park, where protesters would gather almost 40 years ago before setting off on civil rights marches. Here birds twitter above a statue of Martin Luther King Jr, sculptures of heroes who endured beyond provocation, and representations of police setting slavering dogs on young blacks. Carvings in stone say at each entrance that it is a ""place of revolution and reconciliation"". Come dusk, this holy place in the movement's history is also a gay pick-up spot and hang-out for the homeless. Behind a monument, out of sight of the landmark sites, the Adamsville Church of God operates a soup kitchen from a truck for a dozen people, most of them men, all of them black. ""I just come down here to chill out and to see if I can get me a drink,"" says Jimmy Pless, a 47-year-old former truck driver. ""It's a gay park. This is where we come. The trial? The bombing happened a long time ago. Let God be the judge, let him do what he's got to do. I don't think we should be having the trial after all this time."" His is not the majority view among the quarter-million population of a two-thirds black city that is proud of its transformation from reliance on steel and coal to a medical and technology centre. But still, you can park your car for two-and-a-half hours at a meter in exchange for 25 cents and Mr Pless's bottle of wine costs $2.65. A local radio station is asking listeners to get in touch: ""Call in to our poll on Frank Cherry. Is he really unable to help with his defence or is he just gold-bricking?"" It is barely worth mentioning the response. An FBI memorandum delivered in 1965, 18 months after the killings, said: ""The bombing was the handiwork of former Klansmen Robert E Chambliss, Bobby Frank Cherry, Herman Frank Cash and Thomas E Blanton jr."" Blanton is said to have driven his '57 Chevy to the church and waited with the others while ""Dynamite Bob"" Chambliss set the bomb. Chambliss was eventually found guilty in 1977, dying in jail eight years later; Cash died without ever facing a jury; Cherry might never come to trial now; which leaves only Blanton, a chip off the old racist block, son of Pops Blanton, a notorious Birmingham white supremacist. Mark Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Centre, says that racist groups are not exactly rallying to the Blanton cause. ""Even if you believe in racial separation, it's difficult to get behind the murder of four little girls. It's also a trial from another era. It's like trying a Nazi war criminal."" That era was one in which blacks, now Afro-Americans, were referred to as negroes in polite society; when freelance bigots performed the role in which today police in cities such as New York, Los Angeles - and now Cincinnati - are cast. There was no direct reference during the Sixteenth Street Easter service to the bombing so long ago, but a reading from Luke 23:24 might have been taken as one: ""And Jesus said: 'Father forgive them; for they know not what they do.'""",2001-04-16T00:50:32Z,"{'polarity': 0.005747448669135409, 'subjectivity': 0.3821880595976981}",0.3821880595976981
society/2001/may/31/asylum,Amnesty attacks Britain on asylum,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/may/31/asylum,"Britain's treatment of refugees is attacked in Amnesty International's annual report published yesterday. And the report criticises the country's record on human rights, notably in Northern Ireland. It described an ""alarming shortfall"" in access to legal advice to dispersed asylum seekers, many of whom had been sent to areas where the local people had no experience of living with them. Up to 1,000 asylum seekers were being held in detention at any one time, it said. Amnesty condemned what it called negative media coverage which ""pandered to racial prejudice and created a hostile environment for many refugees"". The largest groups of asylum-seekers were from Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Somalia, according to Home Office figures. All three countries had poor human rights records, Amnesty noted. Seven hundred Afghan refugees were seeking asylum in April, an increase of 38% on January's figures. Kate Allen, Amnesty International's UK director, said yesterday: ""It is clear that the journey from Afghanistan to the United Kingdom is one from desperation to despair. ""How can we claim to be a just and tolerant society when we greet those fleeing persecution with such hostility and suspicion?"" Amnesty spokesman Brendan Parry said: ""When people think of asylum-seekers they often don't consider what these people are fleeing. ""There are death sentences for political reasons, torture, punishments such as floggings, stonings and amputations and severe restrictions on social freedom. To be so dismissive of them is really adding insult to injury."" In Northern Ireland, said Amnesty, the 2000 Police Act ""failed to highlight the centrality of human rights protection"" and did not include all the measures for police accountability recommended by the 1999 Patten Report. It pointed to the lack of a public inquiry into the killing of the Catholic lawyer Patrick Finucane by loyalist paramilitaries in 1989 and said no action had been taken against RUC officers accused of issuing death threats against Rosemary Nelson, killed by a loyalist car bomb in 1999. Amnesty noted that the coroner leading the inquest into Robert Hamill, kicked to death in Portadown in 1997, ""decided he was unable to hold an inquest because he could not guarantee the safety of a key witness"". Amnesty pointed to deaths in police custody, ill treatment and disputed killings by the police in Britain, including the death of Harry Stanley, shot dead in September 1999 in Hackney, east London, while walking home carrying a repaired table leg in a bag. Mr Stanley had stopped in a pub where a customer mistook his Scottish accent for Irish and the table leg for a shotgun and alerted the police. Armed police approached Mr Stanley from behind after he left the pub and reportedly shouted a warning, noted Amnesty. He did not stop and when he turned round, reportedly after another police shout, he was shot dead. The crown prosecution service decided not to bring criminal charges against the police. In March, Stuart Melchor, a black warehouse manager called to a suspected burglary in north-west London, was bitten by a police dog and clubbed with truncheons by police who mistakenly presumed he was breaking into the building. The human rights movement had grown in strength and the internet had given birth to a network of protest movements promoting causes ranging from the environment to anti-capitalism and third world debt relief, Amnesty's secretary general, Pierre Sane, reported. Yet the Amnesty report documented extrajudicial executions in 61 countries last year, as well as prisoners of conscience in at least 63 countries, arbitrary arrest or detention in 30 countries and torture and ill treatment in 125 countries.",2001-05-31T09:13:14Z,"{'polarity': -0.0693798449612403, 'subjectivity': 0.3248062015503876}",0.3248062015503876
world/2001/apr/27/catholicism.religion,Monks protest at Pope as Greece goes on strike,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/27/catholicism.religion,"Monks at the all-male community of Mount Athos, one of the most revered places in Orthodoxy, will stage an all-night vigil tonight to pray against the Pope's historic visit to Greece next Friday. Their protest comes amid mounting anger by rank-and-file clergy at the church leadership's decision to lift long-held objections to a papal visit. Greece is currently engulfed in a tide of strikes against the Socialist government's social security reforms. Hundreds of thousands of workers took to the streets across the country yesterday, shutting down schools and offices, halting public transport and closing down the media. Even priests heeded the strike call. If the papal visit goes ahead, religious conservatives have predicted widespread protests, and even violence. The 80-year-old John Paul II will pay a 24-hour visit to Greece next Friday to retrace the footsteps of St Paul the Apostle, making him the first pope to visit the country since the ""great schism"" of 1054 which split Christianity into eastern and western branches. The Pope will make a pilgrimage to the Areopagus, the hill to the west of the Acropolis where St Paul preached the Sermon of the Unknown God. He will also celebrate mass at the Olympic indoor sports stadium. The tour then takes him to Syria and Malta. Moderates within the Greek Orthodox church hope the trip will help heal nearly 1,000 years of deep distrust between the churches. Many Orthodox faithful blame the Vatican for what they perceive to be centuries of misdeeds against them - from the sacking of Constantinople by crusaders in 1204 to the bombing of Orthodox Serbia in 1999. ""We expect the Pope to make a humble gesture of love and apology,"" said Haris Konidaris, the spokesman for Archbishop Christodoulos, the head of the Greek church. ""Then the fanatics here will be silenced."" The archbishop has repeatedly called for calm from Greece's ultra-Orthodox groups, including the influential Old Calendarists, who boast some 800,000 followers. ""The faithful will take to the streets; blood could be shed,"" warnedone black-robed monk. ""Out with the two-horned beast, the Pope of Rome 666!"" read a banner. ""No to the leader of heresy,"" read another. Police have tightened security at Catholic churches across Greece. But fears for the Pope's safety have been raised since the weekend, too, when a home-made bomb exploded outside the offices of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Athens. No one was hurt in the afternoon blast, which was claimed by anarchists. Last week, Bartholomew I, head of the Eastern Orthodox church whose seat is in Istanbul, had welcomed the papal trip and he accused opponents of displaying ""ecclesiastical provincialism"".",2001-04-27T11:03:52Z,"{'polarity': 0.02413194444444445, 'subjectivity': 0.3097222222222222}",0.3097222222222222
world/2001/jan/03/israel,Militants hold gun to Arafat's head,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/03/israel,"The Islamic militant group, Hamas, issued a deadly threat yesterday to the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, warning that it would turn its campaign of terror against him should he agree to a peace deal with President Bill Clinton. The leader of Hamas on the West Bank, Hassan Youssof, in an interview with the Guardian, accompanied the chilling warning with a prediction that Mr Arafat would be forced to reject the proposed settlement. Until now, Hamas, the most feared of the Palestinian guerrilla groups, has struck only against Israeli targets. Although it has long opposed Mr Arafat's peace negotiations, it is now threatening to extend its campaign of violence to the Palestinian Authority leadership. Mr Youssof said the political danger for Mr Arafat was that he could end up being confronted not only by Hamas but also a breakaway from his own organisation, Fatah, which he claimed had established strong links with Hamas since the uprising began in September. The Hamas warning adds to the already enormous pressure on Mr Arafat, who met Mr Clinton in Washington last night to discuss the US peace plan. Mr Youssof said all three key elements of the proposed peace settlement - the fate of the Palestinian refugees, the future of the Jerusalem holy site and the territorial division - were unacceptable. He added: ""As a Palestinian organisation, we refuse any agreement that does not give the Palestinian people three things: the right of its refugees to return to their homes; all of Jerusalem; and gets all settlers out of the West Bank and Gaza."" The US proposals offer none of those. Mr Youssof, 49, who has been jailed by Israel and the Palestinian Authority, hinted strongly that Israel could expect a return to suicide bombings, a campaign that created terror in Israel between 1994 and 1996. ""Hamas will not stop fighting and bombing until the occupation is over,"" he said. Israel has suffered two big bomb explosions in the last week, one in Tel Aviv and the other, on Monday night, in the coastal town of Netanya in which more than 30 people were wounded. Israeli police said that one of those it believed to be responsible for planting the bomb was in a critical condition. Hamas described the bombing as the ""holy right"" of the Palestinian people but did not accept responsibility, which was claimed by a previously unknown group, the Vanguard of the Popular Army. Hamas often denies responsibility in order to avoid retaliation or a crackdown. Hamas, which was partly financed by the Islamic terrorist Osama bin Laden until he had to flee from Sudan in 1996, was founded in 1987, during the first intifada. The first Hamas suicide bomber killed eight Israelis when he rammed a car filled with explosives into a crowd in northern Israel in April 1994. The casualty rate over the next two years was high, as was the psychological toll on Israelis because the willingness of the bombers to die meant they could strike almost anywhere. The campaign was brought to an end when Mr Arafat, under pressure from Israel, jailed about 900 members of Hamas, most of them since released. Mr Arafat worked against Hamas with the CIA and Israeli intelligence, Mossad. Mr Youssof said he could not predict what individual cells of the Izzedine al-Qassem, the armed wing of Hamas, were plotting but he regarded suicide bombings as a justifiable Palestinian response to Israel's use of all the weapons in its arsenal other than nuclear and chemical weapons. ""We have a rule from the Koran and Mohammed that we should not kill any animal or people. [But] we use this kind of bombing to frighten them into stopping killing our people and children."" If, as Mr Youssof expects, Mr Arafat has no choice but to reject the deal because of the division it would create among Palestinians, he predicted that Hamas would join forces with Fatah - the biggest grouping within Mr Arafat's Palestinian Liberation Organisation - and other Palestinians in a united and bigger effort against Israel. ""Fatah is now with Hamas,"" he said. Confronted by Israelis killing Palestinians, Mr Youssof said the Palestinians had no choice: ""If people go to your home to kill one or two of your kids or throw you out on to the streets, will we give them roses or will we fight?"" Hamas had been increasingly isolated within Palestinian society because of its opposition to the peace process that led to the Israeli-Palestinian agreement at Oslo in 1993. But support for Hamas has increased since the latest intifada began in September, especially in universities. Mr Youssof said the strength of feeling against the peace negotiations would be underlined in huge demonstrations planned for tomorrow in the West Bank. ""Seven years of negotiation with Israel did not give us anything of our rights but it has doubled the number of [Israeli] settlements, closed down our economy, destroyed homes, and given them control of the whole of Jerusalem."" Israel blames Mr Arafat for the resurgence of Hamas violence because he released many of the group's members from jail soon after the latest intifada began. Palestinian Authority leaders claim that, although they did release them from jails because they were under threat from Israeli helicopter attacks, almost all of them have been rearrested. Part of the reason Mr Arafat threw open the jails was because of demonstrations in favour of the release of Hamas in places such as Nablus. However, Mr Youssof said that of the 120 held in Palestinian Authority jails before the intifada, only 25 had been rearrested. More than 1,200 Hamas members are held in Israel. He admitted that the alliance of the Palestinian, Israeli and US intelligence agencies had weakened Hamas. Its bomb-makers and others with technical experience had been singled out and assassinated. But Mr Youssof said Hamas would emerge stronger from the intifada.

world/2001/jun/19/israel,Eta 'sold Hamas bombers dynamite',World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/19/israel,"The Hamas suicide bombers who have wreaked havoc in Israel recently are being resupplied with explosives by the Basque separatist group Eta, Spain's El Mundo newspaper claimed yesterday. The Spanish interior minister, Mariano Rajoy, said yesterday he could not confirm El Mundo's report, which was based on information from ""unnamed separatist sources"". But he said he would not be surprised if it was true. ""On numerous occasions we have had clear proof of the relationship between terrorist groups,"" he said. The Spanish news magazine Tiempo, in a separate report, quoted unnamed French police sources as confirming that a deal had been struck between Hamas and Eta at a meeting last September in northern Italy. That deal, police said, saw Eta sell a stock of Titadine dynamite, stolen from a French factory by a commando unit made up of members of Eta and the Breton Revolutionary Army (BRA), for small arms and money. The explosives apparently came from a haul of eight tonnes of dynamite stolen from a Titadine factory in Plevin, Brittany, in September 1999. The dynamite was split between Eta, which was at the time nominally observing a unilateral ceasefire, and the BRA. Although French police recovered part of the explosives, Eta kept up to four tonnes of dynamite - several times what it has used in the 19 car bombs it has planted in Spanish cities since then. El Mundo said Hamas and Eta were brought together by a middle eastern arms dealer. ""The material was handed over in an eastern European country where there are organised mafia groups trading in arms, and specialists in money laundering,"" the French sources told Tiempo. They did not say when the explosives were handed over, nor whether they had reached Israel. Israeli diplomats in Madrid said they could not confirm the deal or a visit allegedly made by 10 Hamas members to the Basque country over the New Year. ""But it seems logical that two terrorist groups should work together,"" said an embassy spokesman. However, an Israeli expert on Islamic militant groups was sceptical. ""I don't think Hamas needs to import explosives from Eta,"" said Ely Karmon of Israel's International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism. ""Hamas has their own laboratories in the territories, and the necessary people and materials to prepare explosives."" He said Hamas bombers generally used poor-quality, locally made chemical explosives, boosting their lethal effect by packing bombs with nails, ball bearings and bullets. Mr Karmon also said it would be very difficult for Hamas, which had not shown a network beyond the Israeli-occupied territories, to smuggle explosives into that area. The military wing of Hamas, Izzedine al-Kassem, has claimed seven suicide attacks inside Israel since the election of the hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon. The deadliest by far was the June 1 bombing of a disco on the Tel Aviv beach front which killed 20 Israelis, mainly teenage girls. Before that attack, Israeli intelligence officials had said Hamas's bombing capabilities had been crippled by Israeli assassinations of key engineers, and by the Palestinian Authority's detention of several military figures. Eta has killed 30 people since it returned to arms after ending a 14-month ceasefire last January; 16 of those were killed by bombs made with the dynamite stolen from Plevin. The BRA has also used the explosives in bomb attacks, killing a 27-year-old woman employee of a McDonalds hamburger restaurant in Quévert last April. But it later handed back a large quantity of explosives as a sign that it was not prepared to take the armed campaign any further. Eta, reportedly concerned that it could no longer store the ageing Titadine safely, replenished its explosive supplies with a second raid in France in March this year. The raid was carried out at an explosives warehouse near Grenoble by eight masked gunmen who stole 1.6 tonnes of dynamite and 20,000 detonators.",2001-06-19T01:02:32Z,"{'polarity': 0.005448898927159795, 'subjectivity': 0.27535761340109166}",0.27535761340109166
world/2001/jun/13/1,41 countries send children into war,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/13/1,"Three hundred thousand children under-18 are participating in hostilities in some 41 countries affected by serious ongoing armed conflict, according to a new report from the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers. The report is highly critical of Britain - one of the few western countries to use minors in combat: ""The United Kingdom has persistently objected to raising the international minimum age for voluntary recruitment and participation in hostilities to 18. ""Within Europe the UK has the lowest minimum age for recruitment, the highest recruitment of under-18s into the regular armed forces and the lowest deployment age. The UK is also the only European country to send minors routinely into battle,"" it says. One of the worst affected countries is Sierra Leone, where thousands of children have been forcibly recruited into some of the most vicious fighting in the world today. One former child soldier at a care centre in Lunghi run by the charity Caritas Makeni described how he had taken part in cross-border raids into Guinea. There they would surround villages and press gang the youths into rebel forces - a method similar to that used by the Revolutionary United Front several years ago. While hundreds of children have been demobilised in recent weeks, there is concern that many in Sierra Leone's civil defence force (CDF) will fail to be counted. The disarmament process requires one weapon to be handed over for each person entering demobilisation. As each CDF detachment consists of about 30 people (about a third of them children) sharing around three weapons, care workers fear the numbers are severely under-reported. Children serving in pro-government militias such as the Kamajors and Gbethis are mostly volunteers, unlike those abducted by the RUF. But Alphonso Bagni of Caritas said: ""Children serving in the CDF have often been as corrupted by the use of arms as those with rebel units. ""Ten-year-old kids fighting on the front line or demanding money while manning road-blocks often end up almost as badly socialised as the children abducted by their opponents."" The danger of failing to demobilise pro-government militias was demonstrated by an incident last year involving the theoretically pro-government West Side Boys last year. After the derailment of the peace process in May 2000, they began a campaign of pillage that culminated in the kidnap of British military advisers in August. In September British troops raided their hideout. The captives were freed but a rescuer was killed. Olara Otunnu, UN special representative for children and armed conflict, says it is vital to give Africa's lost generation a stake in the peace: ""They have no choice but to deal with the children of war. They could be sitting on a time-bomb."" Rory McGovern, of the Coalition, said: ""What happens in Sierra Leone will be a litmus test for efforts to stop child soldiering around the world. The international community knows what is needed - now we need to see the resources and political will to make it work."" Due to the sensitivity surrounding the use of child soldiers in Sierra Leone, and the stipulation that no one under 18 is deployed in the new army being established by Britain's military training team (Matt), none of the army's estimated 5,000 17-year -olds are deployed there. The UN recently forbade the use of under-18s in peacekeeping but British troops in the Nato-led K-For and S-For have no such restrictions. Lisa Alfredson, a spokeswoman for the Coalition, said: ""It's ironic that Britain should itself recruit at the age of 16 and insist that the armies it is training should have a minimum recruitment age of 18."" Although Britain has signed the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child - the May 2000 amendment to the international law governing the rights of children which stipulates 18 as the minimum age for recruitment - it has exercised ""an interpretative declaration"" on deployment.",2001-06-13T01:04:04Z,"{'polarity': -0.031630076272933405, 'subjectivity': 0.3261692672406958}",0.3261692672406958
world/2001/apr/18/usa.julianborger,Bunker-busting US 'mini-nukes' alarm scientists,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/18/usa.julianborger,"The Pentagon is examining the feasibility of producing a low-yield nuclear warhead capable of hitting deep fortified targets such as Saddam Hussein's underground bunkers. But US scientists warned yesterday that ""mini-nukes"" would lower the threshold of nuclear war. The Pentagon is due to report to the Senate in July in response to a Republican request to it and the energy department to find a way of destroying ""hardened and deeply buried targets"". But a Pentagon spokesman insisted yesterday that work on mini-nukes had not yet begun. ""The 2001 defence authorisation bill authorises us to review the requirements for a weapon to use against hardened and deeply buried targets,"" Lieutenant-Colonel Steve Campbell said. ""There has been no research and development."" A 1994 law prohibits the US developing a nuclear warhead of less than 5 kilotonnes, lest ""low-yield nuclear weapons blur the distinction between nuclear and conventional war"". The request by two Republican hawks, Senators John Warner and Wayne Allard, to find a way of destroying targets such as underground bunkers directly challenges that law. Testing a mini-nuke would breach the 1996 comprehensive test ban treaty, too. There is thought to be support for developing such a weapon in the energy department's nuclear research laboratories and the Pentagon. An adviser to the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, told the Washington Post this week that President Saddam would not be deterred by any of the nuclear warheads in the US arsenal, ""because he knows a US president would not drop a 100-kilotonne bomb on Baghdad"". In theory a mini-nuke missile released by a plane would point towards its target and fire its rocket motors, driving it deep underground. The weak nuclear charge would be exploded after a time-delay and the blast, supporters say, would be contained in the hole dug by the missile. But a report by the Federation of American Scientists argues that the Earth-penetrating bombs now being tested have only penetrated 6 metres (20ft) below the surface. A nuclear blast at that depth, the report says, ""will simply blow out a huge crater of radioactive material, creating a lethal gamma-radiation field over a large area"". Robert Sherman, head of the federation's nuclear security project, said: ""We have gone 56 years without a nuclear weapon being used anywhere. There is universal recognition that once you use the first nuclear weapon it becomes a great deal easier for someone to use the second. ""Its incredibly stupid to think you can use a small nuclear weapon, cross the nuclear firebreak and get away from it. ""Trying to sell it on the rationale that it can be used without collateral damage and that will be the end of it ... is incredibly irresponsible.""",2001-04-18T01:30:08Z,"{'polarity': 0.02159863945578232, 'subjectivity': 0.40688775510204084}",0.40688775510204084

world/2001/apr/06/israel1,Israel attacks Palestinian police stations,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/06/israel1,"Israel launched a rocket attack on two Palestinian police stations today and knocked out power to thousands of homes after four Israeli communities were attacked by Palestinian mortar fire. Meanwhile, a leading Islamic militant killed in an explosion attributed to Israeli forces was buried in the town of Jenin in the West Bank. Eight men in white robes, meant to symbolise the death shrouds of suicide bombers, carried the flag-draped body of Iyad Hardan through the streets, followed by some 5,000 mourners. Mr Hardan was killed yesterday when a public phone he used exploded and a thirst for revenge dominated the mood at his funeral today. He was a follower of the Islamic Jihad group, which has carried out a series of attacks in Israel in recent months. Two other suspected Islamic militants held in the Jenin jail were released after his death, it has been reported. The Israeli rocket attacks on northern Gaza early today came in response to mortar fire on three Jewish settlements and an Israeli communal farm on the border with the Gaza Strip. No one was hurt by the mortar shells. In the past, Israel had only launched air strikes if Israelis were killed or wounded in Palestinian attacks. The rockets knocked out large parts of the facade of a two-story building in a residential neighbourhood of the town of Beit Lahiya. Palestinian police had moved out of the area when they heard the gunships approaching, although two bystanders were hit by shrapnel. In several West Bank towns, including Hebron and Ramallah, Palestinians threw stones at Israeli soldiers. In Ramallah, troops fired rubber-coated bullets and tear gas, injuring 19 Palestinians, according to paramedics at the scene. Israeli officials, meanwhile, said they would step up retaliation for Palestinian shootings, bombings and mortar attacks. Israel will strike back ""relentlessly"" and Palestinian security installations will be considered targets as long as security forces fail to prevent attacks on Israelis, said Raanan Gissin, a top aide to the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon. The internal security minister, Uzi Landau, said Israeli forces should hit Palestinian targets ""every day, hour after hour"". He told Israel radio that ""the price we will exact from the Palestinian Authority will become intolerable.""

The web attack follows yesterday's admission by Hamas that it was responsible for Sunday's suicide bombing at Netanya, in which a bomber and three Israelis were killed. Hamas's military wing, the Izz el-deen al-Qassam brigades, had said in a statement that Ahmed Omar Alian, 23, a prayer caller at a refugee camp, had carried out the bombing. That statement described Alian as a ""hero and a martyr"", the Jerusalem Post newspaper said. Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of the political wing of Hamas, told the Reuters news agency that he thought Israeli intelligence was behind the attack. ""I'm telling them to die of their own fury,"" Yassin told the agency. He accused the hackers of trying to ""disfigure the image of Islam"". The web attack is just the latest incident in the Middle East's internet war. In January a 16-year-old Israeli was shot dead after meeting a Palestinian woman in an internet chatroom and arranging to meet her. Last year the website of Hizbullah, the Arab guerrilla group, was altered to display the Israeli flag. And in October Albawaba.com, a Jordanian-based portal site, was crashed by supporters of Israel - who bombarded its chatroom with emails containing large and offensive image files.

world/2001/feb/15/israel,West rebukes Israel's assassins,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/15/israel,"International opprobrium was directed at Israel yesterday for its state-approved assassinations of suspected terrorists - a practice widely regarded as illegal. A Foreign Office spokesman said the British government was shocked by what it described as the ""murder"" of one of Yasser Arafat's bodyguards by Israeli forces on Tuesday and of nine Israeli soldiers by a Palestinian yesterday. ""We condemn all acts of violence and urge both sides to refrain from reprisals. Neither side will gain from an escalation of the violence,"" the spokesman said. Earlier, the outgoing Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, had publicly congratulated Israeli forces on the killing of the bodyguard, Massoud Ayad, whose car was rocketed by two helicopters. Yesterday's attack, in which a Palestinian driver ploughed into Israeli soldiers at a bus stop, is thought to be a reprisal for Ayad's killing. ""This is exactly the kind of escalation we had feared,"" said a European diplomat close to recent peace negotiations. Mr Barak's security adviser, Danny Yatom, defended the assassination of Ayad, telling Israel Radio: ""We don't take pride in liquidating terrorists. We are in the midst of a battle, in the midst of a war against terrorism, and in this war we must strike at those who [threaten Israel]."" He described Mr Ayad, 53, an ""arch terrorist"" linked to the Lebanon-based organisation Hizbollah. Britain has also backed one of the strongest statements yet from the European Union. In a declaration issued by current president Sweden, the EU said it ""deplores the practice of so-called ""eliminations"" or extra-judicial killings of Palestinians carried out by Israeli security forces"". The EU, which is Israel's biggest trading partner, reiterated ""its strongly held opinion that Israel's policy in this regard is unacceptable and contrary to the rule of law"". It continued: ""The European Union urges Israel to cease this practice and thus respect international law."" The United States, while also condemning Palestinian violence, made clear its disapproval of the assassinations. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said: ""The use of Israeli helicopter gunships, Palestinian attacks against settlements and motorists, the use of mortars by Palestinians and the targeted killings by the Israeli Defence Force ... are producing a new cycle of action or reaction which can become impossible to control."" Mr Boucher added that the new Secretary of State, Colin Powell, who is due to visit the Middle East next week, had spoken several times ""about the need to avoid these kind of actions"". Apart from the risk of provoking reprisals which escalate the violence, liquidations have also caused unintended casualties. Israel began selective assassinations of suspected senior Intifada militants in November, sending helicopter gunships to kill Hussein Abayat in Bethlehem on the same day that Mr Arafat was visiting the White House in Washington. On that occasion, the rocket which hit the vehicle in which Mr Abayat was travelling also killed two elderly Palestinian women nearby and injured 10 other people. More than 20 Palestinians have been liquidated by Israeli forces in targeted attacks. Under international law, the assassinations are illegal unless the Israelis and Palestinians are considered to be at war. Colonel Daniel Reisner, the Israeli military's head of international law, wrote recently in a briefing document: ""International law actually only recognises two situations: peace and war. But life isn't as simple as that."" He continued: ""We have reached the decision that the current situation has more of a semblance of war than of peace. As a result, we are also applying the principles applicable to warfare to the current situation."" This led him to conclude that the assassination of various Palestinian activists and militia leaders could be justified under the rules of war. ""You are allowed to target combatants,"" he wrote. ""In the current situation, people who attack us have been identified by us as combatants. As a result we view them as legitimate targets. That specific individual falls under that category, therefore he was attacked and killed."" For the Israelis, one problem with this interpretation is that it would also have to apply equally to the Palestinians. Palestinians would then be legally entitled to kill Israeli soldiers (as happened yesterday) and anyone else they regard as a combatant, such as armed settlers. The death toll so far • February 13 2001: Massoud Ayad killed by rocket attack. • December 31 2000: Thabet Thabet shot dead. • December 17: Samih Maliabi killed by bomb - possibly a booby-trapped mobile phone. • December 14: Hani Abu Bakra shot dead by anti-terror police unit. • December 13: Abbas al-Ewiwi shot dead by snipers. • December 12: Yusuf Abu Swayeh ambushed by elite Kingfisher undercover unit. • December 11:Anwar Hamran shot by Israeli forces.

world/2001/apr/23/chechnya.qanda,Chechnya,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/23/chechnya.qanda,"Is there a dirty war? Conventional fighting between Russian and Chechen forces has for the most part ceased, but human rights organisations have reported a rise in the disappearance, torture and summary executions of detainees. Human Rights Watch describes the situation as a transition from an internal armed conflict to a classic dirty war. How extensive is this dirty war? Human Rights Watch has documented more than 113 cases of ""disappearances"" in Chechnya since Russia launched its military campaign against the rebellious province in September 1999. A leading Russian human rights group, the Memorial Human Rights Centre, put the figure at 150, but the full number is believed to be much higher. The total number of dead from the military campaign is estimated at between 30,000 and 40,000. Has there been any international response? Last week, the UN Commission on Human Rights condemned Russia for what it said was the ""excessive and indiscriminate"" use of force by its troops in Chechnya. But Russia is not paying much attention. A similar UN resolution was approved last year, but Russia simply ignored calls to allow UN human rights monitors into Chechnya or to set up a national commission of inquiry. The discovery of a mass grave of 60 Chechen civilians in January has only heightened international concern. Why are Russian troops in Chechnya? Russia launched a military campaign against Chechnya in September 1999 - the latest in a series - after a spate of massive explosions in Moscow that was blamed on Chechen extremists. Russian troops captured the capital Grozny after a fierce bombing campaign modelled on Nato's air war in Kosovo. The Chechnya campaign helped cement Vladimir Putin's position as Russia's new president. Has Russia always had troubled relations with Chechnya? The rebellious Chechens have never accepted Russian rule ever since they were conquered in the 19th century. Stalin tried to pacify the northern Caucusus province by deporting the whole population, including women and children, to Siberia. But the survivors returned and Chechens to this day are a thorn in Russia's side. Why is Russia worried about Chechnya? Chechnya's is Russia's wild west. Crime and lawlessness run rampant, but what particularly worries Moscow is attempts by various Islamic chieftain to create an Islamic state incorporating Chechnya and neighbouring Dagestan. Part of the reason Russia launched its 1999 campaign was the inability of Chechen leaders to control their more extreme elements as they had agreed to after the 1996 war. Who is in charge in Chechnya now? A pro-Kremlin administration runs Chechnya led by Akhmad Kadyrov, but several of its members have been picked off by Chechen rebels. Earlier this month, Mr Kadyrov's deputy, Adam Deniyev, was assassinated in a bomb attack on a local television studio. Chechen rebels claim to have compiled a death list of all officials in Chechnya appointed by the Russian government. Any Chechen who agrees to work for the Russian-imposed local government is considered a traitor.

world/2001/apr/15/stephenkhan.theobserver,... and there's always the Libyan desert,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/15/stephenkhan.theobserver,"It may seem an unlikely destination for holidaymakers. But Libya is trying to extinguish the Western image of it as a pariah state and become an oasis for Britons seeking hooligan-free sunshine and culture without queues. A plan to develop tourism in the North African state is being implemented by the country's Tourism Investment and Promotion Board. A source at the board said Libya was keen to welcome tourists from the UK. 'The British will love the historic archeological sites, the desert and the weather. We are developing parts of the country to create the infrastructure required for visitors.' Libya even hired a British consultancy. Jim Fletcher, 47, who recently completed work on the project, said: 'Our 20-year forecast came up with a figure of just over one million visitors by 2020.' Around 60,000 tourists a year now travel to Libya, but few make the journey from the UK, with the country still largely seen as a haven for terrorists and religious fundamentalists. Fletcher was a regular visitor when working on the project for London-based High-Point Rendell and considers such views to be outdated. 'Most of Libya's 60,000 tourists come from France, Italy and Germany,' said Fletcher.' While resorts and luxury hotels are being built, Libya is aiming at select areas of the market and has no plans to take on the Costas of Spain or the Greek islands in a beach war. Fletcher said: 'Remember that alcohol isn't available and won't be in the conceivable future. That will put off a lot of people.' Lovers of Classical ruins will find ancient temples and theatres dramatically sited beside the Mediterranean, and statues and mosaics as fine as any in Europe. All they lack are the crowds. Tripoli boasts a castle, a harbour, a maze of alleys and covered markets, and fine examples of Ottoman and Italian architecture. Close by are two Roman sites: Sabratha and Leptis Magna. Libyans are hospitable to visitors and, unlike many North African destinations, the country's streets and souks are free of touts. The 1,600-mile coastline remains largely unspoilt, and the route from Tripoli to the second city, Ben-ghazi, offers spectacular views. British travellers to Libya need a visa and must be part of an organised group, although this latter requirement could be dropped soon. A few tour operators and airlines such as British Airways jumped into the market soon after the relaxation of sanctions two years ago when Libya handed over two suspects in the Lockerbie bomb case. The bid to prise pounds out of British pockets has come from Muammar Gadaffi, Libya's leader. 'Nothing happens in Libya without the man at the top's say so,' said Fletcher. 'It was the Libyan government that funded our study, so clearly Gadaffi wants tourists from our country to visit his.' Libya is prepared to spend several million pounds on creating the infrastructure needed: new roads, possibly a new airport, desert lodges and beach resorts.",2001-04-15T22:59:39Z,"{'polarity': 0.10874163715072807, 'subjectivity': 0.2701096252232616}",0.2701096252232616
world/2001/may/23/israel4,Sharon rejects call for freeze on settlements,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/23/israel4,"Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, deflated hopes last night that a US report could serve as a first step to ending eight months of bloodshed in the Middle East by rejecting one of its main conditions. In a televised news conference, Mr Sharon said Israel would not heed one of the central recommendations of the report by the respected peacemaker and former US senator, George Mitchell: that there should be an immediate freeze on illegal Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. However, he responded positively to the recommendation for an end to violence by both Israel and the Palestinians, by calling for a ceasefire. ""The government regards settlements in all their forms as a vital national enterprise,"" Mr Sharon said. He addressed the highly sensitive issue only after being questioned by a reporter. He said the government would not found new settlements in addition to the 145 Jewish outposts that dot the hills of the West Bank and the sand dunes of Gaza, but added that ""the government will provide for ongoing requirements of the development of existing settlements"". A leading Palestinian official expressed anger last night at Mr Sharon's intransigence. ""Settlements are illegal and they were built under the occupation forces in Palestinian territory,"" said Ahmed Abdel Rahman, general secretary of the Palestinian Authority. ""The Palestinian people will resist the settlement occupation because settlement activity is a time bomb that will destroy the peace process. ""Unless the Palestinians hear an obvious word to remove the occupation and the settlements, the Palestinians have no choice but to continue the resistance through this intifada."" Mr Sharon's refusal to give any ground on the notion of ""natural growth"" of the Jewish settlements - or new constructions within the exceedingly generous existing boundaries - seriously undermines any prospect that the Mitchell report can serve as a blueprint peace agreement, analysts said. Instead, Mr Sharon sought last night to defer the question of settlements. ""When the terrorism stops, when there has been a proper cooling-off period as proposed by the Mitchell report, we shall most certainly be prepared to hold discussions with the Palestinian Authority,"" he said, but added: ""As long as they behave like a terrorist organisation I think we have to behave as we do to a terrorist organisation."" Yesterday, the Middle East envoys of the United Nations and European Union backed the Mitchell committee's call for a halt to settlements. That pressure could grow amid evidence that Mr Sharon's pledge not to build settlements is a hollow one - a Peace Now survey found 15 new outposts in the West Bank had been built since his election last February, at distances of up to 700 metres from existing settlements. Washington continued its re-engagement in Middle East peacemaking yesterday. The US ambassador to Tel Aviv, Martin Indyk, met Mr Sharon to discuss the Mitchell report. He reportedly told the envoy that he wanted a cooling-off period of at least two months before he implements the confidence-building measures recommended by the report.

world/2001/mar/29/israel2,Talking of war,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/29/israel2,"Israeli and Palestinian leaders are talking today of open, unrestrained war. This week has already seen an explosive increase in violence. All Israel was enraged when a Palestinian gunman shot dead a Jewish infant in the occupied West Bank. That atrocity was followed by a clutch of deadly bomb explosions within Israel, in the latest of which an Islamist suicide bomber killed himself and two Israeli teenagers. The response has been no less savage. On Wednesday night Israeli helicopter gunships blasted Palestinian positions in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, including the home of the Palestinian National Authority president, Yasser Arafat. And this morning three more Palestinians have been shot dead in running battles with Israeli occupation troops. The new hardline Israeli government led by Ariel Sharon is clearly in belligerent mood. Environment minister Tzahi Hanegbi spoke today of a coming ""very lengthy"" battle. ""This could likely lead to war, but with the disposition of forces facing each other, this would not be a war in the classic sense,"" he said. Indeed, Israel has an overwhelming military advantage over Yasser Arafat ragbag forces. But the Palestinians are in do-or-die mood, with their fragile economy close to collapse after nearly six months of Israeli blockade. Arafat himself is talking of the start of a ""100 day war"", and has warned the Palestinians of the occupied territories to prepare for a prolonged military assault. His warning appeared to be backed up by one of the leading hawks in the Israeli cabinet, Avigdor Lieberman. ""As the prime minister has said, this is not a reaction, this is not a one-time operation. This is the opening phase of an overall policy whose aim is putting an end to terror. The difference must be that the political echelon gives full backing to the security forces to do everything they can and know how to do, full freedom of operation,"" he said. One of the few rays of light in the encircling gloom of bloodshed and aggression has been the marked change of tack by Washington. Under President Bill Clinton, American policy was based on virtually unqualified support of Israel. That support remains, as witnessed by the US veto in the United Nations of a proposal to send an observer force to the region - a long-held Palestinian objective. But President George Bush shows little inclination to back Israel all the way. Both the White House and the State Department have sharply criticised the latest bombardments in the occupied territories, while calling for an end to Palestinian militant attacks.

world/2001/mar/29/balkans1,Albanians held for massacre of Serbs,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/29/balkans1,"SAS soldiers in Kosovo have seized a group of ethnic Albanians suspected of being involved in the mass killing of Serbs, it was confirmed yesterday. Four of those detained are believed to have been identified as members of the Kosovo Protection Corps, which grew out of the Kosovo Liberation Army and is headed by the KLA's commander, Agim Ceku. KLA members were trained by the SAS before it was disbanded after the Kosovan war, and the arrests are likely to embarrass Nato, the UN, and other international agencies trying to impose law and order in the Serbian province. Members of 22 SAS Regiment trained in counter-terrorist warfare were sent to Kosovo last week at the request of the British commander in Kosovo, Brigadier Hamish Rollo, to spearhead a surveillance operation involving 3,000 British and Norwegian troops. They detained 22 ethnic Albanians in the provincial capital, Pristina, and near the north-eastern town of Podujevo, where seven Serbs were killed and 43 injured six weeks ago by a bomb which destroyed the first of a convoy of five buses taking families from the Serbian city of Nis to Gracanica in Kosovo. The incident was described by Brigadier Robert Fry, then a senior British K-For commander, as ""a ruthless premeditated attack of mass murder"". Nato and British commanders described the arrests as evidence of the tough action now being taken against extremists. The leaking of the SAS's role in the operation reinforces the message. Former KLA members have long been suspected of killing and intimidating Kosovan Serbs. Yesterday a K-For spokesman, Axel-Bernd Jandesek, said the force had detained 80 ethnic Albanian guerrillas operating in Macedonia, some of whom might be KLA veterans and Protection Corps members. Another K-For spokesman, Squadron Leader Richard Heffer, said troops patrolling the Kosovo-Macedonia border had intercepted light machine guns, 9,240 rounds of ammunition, and more than 100 rifle-launched grenades, in the past month, and detained about 200 suspected insurgents coming from or going towards Macedonia. Macedonian forces, backed by artillery, tanks and helicopter gunships began attacking insurgents along the Kosovan border yesterday. The rebels vowed to fight back. The government's offensive was aimed mainly at the village of Gracane. Its spokesman, Antonio Milososki, said: ""This is our final operation to ... establish control of this stretch of land. We want to create conditions for continuation of political dialogue."" The EU foreign and security policy chief, Javier Solana, urged Macedonian leaders to open political talks with ethnic Albanian leaders as soon as possible to avoid the conflict spreading further. Meanwhile Serb forceswere reported to have killed an ethnic Albanian guerrilla leader in the Presevo valley, close to the Macedonian border.

world/2001/mar/07/israel2,Sharon's coalition may prove fragile,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/07/israel2,"Israelis will have a new prime minister this evening - the man they voted for a month and a day ago. Ariel Sharon, leader of the rightwing Likud faction, has assembled a grand coalition of seven factions in the Knesset (parliament). The protracted and bad tempered negotiations have produced the biggest government in Israel's history, with 26 ministers and at least 15 deputies. Altogether, the government will comprise more than a third of the 120-member Knesset. It will also enjoy a comfortable majority in the notoriously fractious single-chamber parliament. But given Israeli politicians' propensity for in-fighting and internecine power plays, the new coalition may prove fragile. One of its early tests is likely to be the involvement of the ultra-orthodox Shas party, which is chiefly supported by Sephardic (eastern) Jews. Rabbi Obadia Josef, the group's spiritual leader, has ordained that its support for the new coalition is conditional upon the continued - and hotly controversial - exclusion of religious students from national service. Sharon, who will be Israel's 11th prime minister, will get more solid support from the Labour party, whose leader and sitting prime minister, Ehud Barak, he sensationally defeated in the February 6 election. The Labour rank and file is bitterly divided over joining the coalition. Nevertheless the party's most senior figure, former four-time prime minister Shimon Peres, has joined Sharon's team as foreign minister. Another senior Labour man, Binyamin Ben-Eliezar, has been given the key defence ministry. Ben Eliezar's deputy will be Dalia Rabin-Pelossof, whose father, Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated because his peace policies. She now heads her own one-woman faction in the Knesset. Sharon's typically bruising approach to coalition building has won him few friends in his own Likud bloc. A party source sarcastically congratulated him for managing to do, in just four weeks, something his predecessors had struggled to achieve: ""He has managed to get nearly everyone in his party to hate him."" dbrown445@aol.com Related articles 07.05.2001: Sharon induction threatened by new violence 07.05.2001: Sharon's 'guard dog' bares his teeth 06.05.2001: Sharon: 'I have formed a government' 05.03.2001: Suicide bomb is new blow to peace 03.03.2001: Jericho under siege once more 27.02.2001: Peres talks Labour into coalition with Sharon 21.02.2001: Barak turns down post in Sharon cabinet Useful links Special report: Israel and the Middle East Government of Israel Jerusalem Post Ha'aretz Jerusalem Report Palestinian National Authority Palestinian Ministry of Information",2001-03-07T13:05:18Z,"{'polarity': 0.10021552521552521, 'subjectivity': 0.49294131794131785}",0.49294131794131785
world/2001/jun/15/spain.usa,US offers to spy on Eta for Spain,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/15/spain.usa,"President George Bush has smoothed his bumpy landing in Europe by holding out the possibility of sharing secrets from the global Echelon electronic eavesdropping system with countries such as Spain that are fighting terrorism at home. Spanish newspapers quoted unnamed security officials yesterday as explaining that the secretive, and officially non-existent, Echelon system could become a key element in the battle against the Basque separatist group Eta. After Mr Bush's visit to Madrid on Tuesday, the Spanish foreign minister, Josep Pique, without mentioning Echelon, confirmed that the US would be spying on Eta's communications for Spain ""A lot can be done from the point of view of technology, information and detecting communications,"" he said. ""It opens a very promising field of action, so that we can definitely defeat terrorism."" That may explain why Mr Bush, who chose to start his first European tour in Spain, received such a rapturous welcome from the prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar. The Spanish government refused to comment on the possible use of Echelon. It would only say that new forms of cooperation with US intelligence services were still being worked on. "" We do not confirm nor deny it,"" a spokesman for Mr Aznar said. But Spanish newspapers quoted unnamed government officials and anti-terrorist police as saying that they expected access to the US satellite network. ""The information gathered by the CIA and by satellites, together with the US capacity for intercepting communications and reading emails, could help keep the terrorist group under control, according to the government,"" El Mundo said. Diario 16 said anti-terrorist officials hoped to use Echelon's satellite technology at specific moments in their campaign against Eta. Mr Bush spent much of his time in Madrid discussing terrorism with Mr Aznar, who survived a 1995 Eta bomb attack and makes fighting the separatist group a priority. He promised to give Mr Aznar all the help he needed. ""To the extent that we can help the government of Spain to fight terrorism within its borders, we will do so,"" he said afterwards, without elaborating. Mr Aznar, in return, immediately came to the president's defence on the big issues that threatened to plague his European tour. He became the first European leader to express qualified support for Mr Bush's controversial missile defence shield and his unilateral decision to abrogate the anti-ballistic-missile treaty with Russia. He also gave some support to Mr Bush's refusal to sign the Kyoto protocol on carbon dioxide emissions, claiming that the president was simply trying to achieve the same ends as the EU, which supports the treaty, but by other means. Use of Echelon to tap Eta communications, much of which originate from its command structure in the south of France, might run up against objections from the French government. France has been the most vocal critic of Echelon, which it fears is being used to spy on its companies. In a hard-hitting report on the Echelon network, the European parliament said last month that any EU state involved in an electronic eavesdropping system used to spy on European citizens and companies would be in breach of both the European convention on human rights and EU law. Spain may have to use the information received from the US with care, newspapers said yesterday. ""There remains a legal doubt in the air, given that the information would reach the interior ministry without being controlled by the judiciary,"" El Mundo said. The Echelon system enables all satellite communications to be intercepted. It is based at Fort Meade in Maryland and at GCHQ in Cheltenham, but also operates from bases in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The system uses super-computers to randomly scan and record millions of phone calls, faxes and emails for key words. The information goes to the US national security agency, which can store five trillion pages of text. Unlike information on US citizens, which officially cannot be kept longer than a year, information on foreigners can he held without a time limit.",2001-06-15T00:38:38Z,"{'polarity': 0.05756198347107438, 'subjectivity': 0.33749016135379767}",0.33749016135379767
world/2001/apr/16/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon,Israel attacks Syrian radars in Lebanon,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/16/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon,"The Israeli army attacked Syrian radar targets in the central mountains of Lebanon last night killing at least three soldiers and injuring five, according to security forces in the country. It was the first Israeli strike against the Syrian positions in the country since 1996. ""Air force planes this evening attacked a radar target of the Syrian army at Dahr el-Baidar, north of the Beirut-Damascus highway in Lebanon,"" an Israeli army spokesman said in Jerusalem last night. He said the attack was in response to Hizbullah attacks in recent months, and most recently last week, when an Israeli soldier was killed in a tank hit by rocketfire near a disputed border zone at the southern Chebaa Farms area. ""The Israeli Defence Forces will not tolerate the continuation of the terrorist policy conducted by Hizbullah operating under the patronage of the Syrian government,"" the army said in a statement. ""The IDF will use all the means at its disposal to ensure the safety of the residents of the northern border and its soldiers."" At least three bomb impacts were heard shortly after midnight in the region, according to witnesses and police. Israeli jets roared past the mountains on several runs as tracers from ground anti-aircraft were fired at the warplanes. The region is dotted with Syrian army troop positions that include radar stations, tanks and armoured personnel carriers. The strike was the first by Israeli warplanes on targets deep inside Lebanon since Israeli forces withdrew from southern Lebanon last May. It was also the first time that Syrian troops were targetted by the Israeli army since 1996, when Israeli helicopter gunships blasted Syrian army positions near Beirut airport during a bombing campaign against Lebanon. Syria, which has 30,000 troops in Lebanon and is the main power broker there, maintains bases and checkpoints for its forces along the crucial highway in mountains. The area is strategic because it overlooks much of the Mediterranean coastline and the eastern Bekaa Valley, all the way to the mountain range that forms the border between Lebanon and Syria. On Saturday, Raanan Gissin, a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, said if Hizbullah attacks continued ""we will be forced to take the necessary action and exercise self defence and strike at Hizbullah targets"". The Israeli defence minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, late Saturday described the Hizbullah attack as ""a sick provocation that has no explanation."" He said his government sent ""a clear message to the governments of Lebanon and Syria that we see them as responsible for what happened."" On Sunday, a special UN envoy said the Hizbullah attack in the disputed Chebaa Farms border zone in southern Lebanon violated the UN-drawn line between Lebanon and Israel. Staffan De Mistura met Sunday with the prime minister, Rafik Hariri, to relay UN concerns about the Hizbullah attack. The Chebaa Farms area was captured by Israel when it overran the Syrian Golan Heights in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Its forces did not withdraw from the area when it ended its 18-year occupation of south Lebanon in May.",2001-04-16T02:54:56Z,"{'polarity': -0.011484593837535015, 'subjectivity': 0.33858543417366943}",0.33858543417366943
world/2001/feb/22/iraq,US fires on Iraqi air defence positions,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/22/iraq,"US warplanes struck Iraqi air defence targets in northern Iraq today, going into action for the first time since last week's attack on targets near Baghdad, the US military said. The US European command said the strike was launched in retaliation against Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery fire at coalition aircraft patrolling a no-fly zone in the north of the country. No British planes were involved in today's attack. ""Coalition aircraft responded to the Iraqi attacks by dropping ordnance on elements of the Iraqi integrated air defence system,"" the command said in a statement. The statement added that all aircraft had returned to base safely. The Operation Northern Watch coalition has patrolled the no-fly zone above the 36th parallel for nine years. It claimed that today's strike was in response to anti aircraft artillery fired from sites north of Mosul, a city 250 miles north of Baghdad. The coalition said aircraft were also targeted by Iraqi radar from sites south-east of Mosul. Meanwhile the Pentagon has admitted that the results of last weekend's airstrikes on Iraqi air defence sites were mediocre at best. A senior Pentagon official said today that far fewer than half the targeted radar were damaged. Early assessments indicate a new satellite-guided missile fired by Navy planes was mainly to blame. ""We have detectable damage on 38-40% of the radars, and we still have some (data) coming in,"" said the official, discussing the Pentagon's preliminary bomb damage assessment on condition of anonymity. Most of the misses were by a margin of 30 to 45 meters, he said.

world/2001/apr/08/russia.comment,Comment: Russia: land of the free,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/08/russia.comment,"As we enter upon a new Cold War, the time has come for all those who value freedom to change sides. Today the aggressive, imperial power bent on imposing its hegemony on the world is the United States. And the power upholding the sanctity of international law is Russia. The Russians now embody the hope of all nations that, no matter how small, they can survive as independent sovereign states. They and the Chinese - deadly rivals during the Cold War - are close allies. The downed US spy plane on Hainan Island helps explain why. The Chinese are understandably fed up with round-the-clock US spying flights near their territory. They are angry at disingenuous US claims that essentially military aircraft flying a few miles from their borders are somehow in 'international air space', and that spy planes landing without permission on Chinese territory are to be considered US sovereign property. Last year Russia logged around 1,000 spying flights by the US and other Nato countries. Ten years ago the Russians, exhausted by 74 years of Communism and a ruinous Cold War, gave up their empire without firing a shot. All they wanted was to be left alone to address their domestic problems, but they did not count on Washington's machinations. Determined to reduce Russia to permanent weakness, the US resolved to surround Russia with Nato satellite states. Swiftly breaking its solemnly proffered pledges at the time of Germany's reunification that Nato would not expand eastwards, the US bullied its junior Nato partners into inviting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to become members. Today, US policymakers talk of inviting the Baltic States to join. Meanwhile, Washington has sought to lock the Russians out of the oil and gas riches of the Caspian Sea, establishing informal military cooperation agreements with the various dictatorships of Central Asia, hinting at eventual Nato membership to such stalwart democracies as Georgia and Azerbaijan. Washington even created a military alliance - GUUAM, comprising Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Moldova - that was obviously directed at Russia. On top of that, the US mobilised Nato against Serbia, Russia's traditional ally, by contemptuously ignoring international law. The bombing violated innumerable articles of the UN Charter, Nato's charter, and the 1975 Helsinki Accords, the cornerstone of détente, and probably the most important international treaty signed since 1945: 'The participating states will refrain... from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state...The participating states will refrain from any intervention... in the internal or external affairs falling within the domestic jurisdiction of another participating state.' When NATO forces arrived in Kosovo, the US violated UN Security Council Resolution 1244, the legal basis for Nato's occupation. American forces did nothing to disarm the KLA, instead helping launch the KLA-led insurgencies in Macedonia and Southern Serbia. Yet, according to 1244, the 'responsibilities of the international security presence in Kosovo include: deterring renewed hostilities... maintaining and where necessary enforcing a ceasefire... demilitarising the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and other armed Kosovo Albanian groups... conducting border monitoring duties as required.' In other words, 1244 followed the Helsinki Final Agreement into the dustbin, Russia's protests at the UN dismissed in Washington as motivated by 'pro-Serb' bias. The Russians confront an administration determined to ignore the 1972 ABM treaty and to build a missile defence system. Washington's claims about threats posed by so-called 'rogue states' fool no one. US policymakers disingenuously profess to be baffled by European and Russian concerns about the missile defence system. It's not complicated. There is no reason for a country to abrogate an arms control treaty unless it wishes to better pursue an aggressive policy. On top of Nato encirclement and possible US invulnerability there are the ethnic separatist movements within the Russian Federation being egged on by the US. Recently, a senior State Department official, John Beyrle, met Ilyas Akhmadov, the Chechen separatist 'foreign minister', right after car bomb attacks in Stavropol killed 22 people. The US, which lectures the rest of the world about the threat from the 'terrorists', gets tongue-tied when terrorism is directed at others. Valdimir Putin made this point starkly, likening the Chechen terrorists to the Albanians attacking Macedonia. 'Nothing has been done to disarm the terrorists,' he said, ' ...and I would like to call those who are attacking Macedonia terrorists, not rebels.' Washington's imperial agenda as well as its anti-Russian intent is no secret. For years it has been a staple of the lavishly-funded foreign policy think-tanks. Consider Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, formerly Dean of the Foreign Policy Institute at Johns Hopkins University, and dominant in the Bush administration. Wolfowitz built a career terrifying the public with lurid tales of global threats facing the US. Demanding US military intervention at every turn, he could be counted to pop up on TV to criticise any policy short of bombing as 'appeasement', and any actual US bombing as little more than 'pinprick strikes'. Wolfowitz shot to fame in 1992 when, as Undersecretary for Policy at the Pentagon, he wrote a memo arguing that US strategy in the post-Cold War world should be to 'establish and protect a new order' that accounts 'sufficiently for the interests of the advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership' while maintaining a military dominance capable of 'deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role'. America über alles. Wolfowitz declared Lithuania to be a 'US vital interest', outlining America's military strategy in a war with Russia over Lithuania. He envisaged using 24 Nato divisions, 70 fighter squadrons and six aircraft carrier battle groups to keep the Russian navy 'bottled up in the eastern Baltic', to bomb supply lines in Russia and use armoured formations to expel Russian forces from Lithuania. The memo was leaked to the press. There was uproar and the then Defence Secretary, now Vice President, Dick Cheney, beat a hasty retreat. Russia, understandably feeling threatened and besieged, is today the champion of all nations seeking to chart their own course. The Russians repeatedly protest the daily Anglo-American bombing of Iraq, actions that have never been authorised by a UN resolution. While US policymakers discuss how best to overthrow Saddam Hussein - never for a moment doubting their right to make such decisions - the Russians insist on adhering to the UN resolutions, which refer exclusively to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. The Russians tirelessly advocate the lifting of sanctions on Iraq, pointing out that the policy hurts the innocent and strengthens Hussein. Talk like this grates in Washington since fear of Saddam, and the Iranian ayatollahs, is the official US justification for its massive military presence in the Persian Gulf. Without the constantly whipped-up fear of the 'rogue sates', US hegemony will be seen for what it is. Russia supports Korean reconciliation pointing out, reasonably, that the outcome will be as much a triumph for South Korea as reunification was for West Germany. Again, this is not a policy much in favour in Washington since it would inevitably bring into question the continuing US military presence in Korea and Japan. The Russians gave up their empire. The Americans are in no mood to give up theirs.",2001-04-08T02:04:28Z,"{'polarity': 0.01986099837662336, 'subjectivity': 0.35752277236652247}",0.35752277236652247
world/2001/may/15/israel1,Violence as Palestinians mark anniversary,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/15/israel1,"Thousands of Palestinians have rallied in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to mark today's anniversary of what they call ""Al Naqba"" - their displacement during the creation of Israel in 1948. At the Karni crossing between Israel and Gaza, a Palestinian was killed and four were wounded when Israeli troops fired on a car, Palestinian police said. In the Gaza town of Beit Hanoun, Israeli tank shells destroyed a Palestinian police station. Near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim in Gaza, Israeli troops fired rubber-coated steel bullets to disperse dozens of Palestinian stone-throwers. At midday, a three-minute siren was to ring out, followed by a taped speech by the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, broadcast to the crowds. Israel's Arab citizens, led by Arab legislators, also planned to hold Al Naqba ceremonies. Mr Arafat left for Cairo this morning, drawing Israeli criticism that he was trying to avoid being blamed for possible violence. Israeli police were on alert amid reports that Palestinians would attempt bomb attacks inside Israel to mark the day, in an atmosphere made all the more volatile by nearly eight months of bloodshed. Since the current round of fighting erupted on September 28 last year, 448 Palestinians and 77 Israelis have been killed. The demonstrations came a day after five Palestinian policemen manning a West Bank checkpoint were killed by Israeli troops in what Mr Arafat called an ""assassination"". Israel said the soldiers had come under fire first, but acknowledged that some of those killed might not have been involved in the shooting. In last year's Al Naqba commemorations, four Palestinians were killed and at least 320 Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers were hurt. Today's events mark the anniversary of Israel's creation on May 15 1948. As Israel declared its independence, five Arab armies invaded, setting off a war that lasted more than a year. During the fighting, an estimated 700,000 Palestinians fled their homes in the newborn Jewish state, many living to this day in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and neighbouring countries. Peace talks between the two sides remain stalled. Jerusalem is due to submit its comments on the recommendations of a fact-finding committee led by former US Senator George Mitchel, although Israel is likely to reject the report's appeal for a freeze on Jewish settlements.The Palestinians said that they would back the entire 32-page report. A key Palestinian demand in the negotiations is to allow the return of all the refugees and their descendants, now numbering about four million people, to their original homes in Israel. Many lived in villages that no longer exist, and Israeli towns and cities have replaced others. Israel maintains that allowing the refugees to return would undermine the Jewish character of their state, where about five million Jews live. Israel agreed to allow thousands of refugees to return in the framework of family reunification, but said that the rest must be resettled in the West Bank and Gaza or countries where they now live. The Palestinians rejected that proposal.

world/2001/jun/08/mcveigh.usa,Appeal court rejects McVeigh plea,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/08/mcveigh.usa,"A federal court in Colorado yesterday rejected an appeal to delay the execution of the Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, ruling that his lawyers had ""utterly failed"" to demonstrate substantial grounds why he should not be put to death next week. McVeigh has decided against pursuing additional appeals and is prepared to die on Monday, his attorneys said later. He could have petitioned the full appeals court or taken his case directly to the supreme court. His lawyers had argued at the 10th US circuit court of appeals in Denver that FBI evidence missing at the original trial showed that someone else could have masterminded the worst terrorist act committed on American soil. The US attorney general, John Ashcroft, issued a statement saying: ""Today's ruling by the 10th circuit is a ruling in favour of justice."" McVeigh has admitted to bombing the Alfred P Murrah federal building on April 19 1995, killing 168 people and injuring 500. Legal experts had predicted that it would be hard to persuade the appeal judges to delay the execution, in part because McVeigh has admitted planting the bomb. In their submission to the court in Denver, Colorado, the convict's lawyers named for the first time two men they say could have been involved in the bombing. ""There was ... evidence, withheld by the government, that another person could well have been the mastermind behind the bombing,"" lawyers Christopher Tritico and Nathan Chambers wrote in a 17-page brief to the court. They cited two documents culled from 4,400 pages recently turned over to the defence. The two items were filed under seal with the court. The attorneys said evidence that someone else had orchestrated the attack and others had participated could have made a critical difference to the jury that decided in 1997 that McVeigh should die instead of serving a life term. One of the men accused by the lawyers of involvement in the bombing was Dennis Mahon, white supremacist leader in Oklahoma whose girlfriend was barred from testifying at McVeigh's trial about co-conspirators by Judge Richard Matsch. The other man was Andreas Strassmeir, a German citizen who lived at an Oklahoma white supremacist compound before the bombing. The lawyers did not say what role they believed these men played. The attorneys' petition to the three-judge bench at the 10th US circuit court of appeals was lodged less than 24 hours after Judge Matsch refused to stop the execution over the FBI's failure to turn over 4,400 pages of documents at trial. McVeigh, 33, a former soldier, is at a federal prison at Terre Haute, Indiana. ""One of the critical [FBI reports] which provided support for the proposition that someone besides Tim McVeigh masterminded the bombing was withheld from two entirely separate [FBI] field offices,"" the lawyers said, citing the same two sealed exhibits. Judge Matsch previously rejected the ""other possible accomplices"" argument, saying no matter what information emerged about the possible actions of others, McVeigh was still the ""instrument of death and destruction"" and deserved to die for his crimes. Mr Tritico and Mr Chambers said in their appeal that under a less restrictive standard, McVeigh ""may be able to present facts that could have called for a life sentence"". The lawyers cited a 1984 decision by the same appeals court which concluded that ""evidence concerning additional perpetrators must be considered by the jury"". The lawyers said the white supremacist's lover barred from testifying at the original trial, Carol Howe, had said that some supremacists were ""prepared to fight a war against the government"" because of how the authorities moved against the Branch Davidian sect in Waco, Texas, in 1993. McVeigh has said that the Waco siege by federal agencies and resulting deaths of sect members were a key reason for his bombing. ""The evidence withheld by the government included precisely the type of information that may have allowed Mr McVeigh to establish a connection [between the bombing and the suspects at the white supremacist compound],"" the lawyers argued.

world/2001/mar/01/israel,"One killed, nine wounded in northern Israel blast",World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/01/israel,"Suspected Palestinian militants set off explosives today in a taxi van after undercover police pursued them for 50 kms (31 miles), stopped the vehicle and tried to arrest them. One person was killed and nine hurt, including three in serious condition, police said. One suspect, who was seriously wounded, was flown by an Israeli air force helicopter to a hospital, police said. It was not immediately clear how many attackers may have been involved, though police said most of the passengers, among them Arabs and Jews, were innocent bystanders. The explosion near the Israeli Arab town of Umm el-Fahem came only a day after police safely detonated a bomb in Tel Aviv left in a plastic bag. Security sources said there might have been a connection between the thwarted Tel Aviv attack and today's explosion. The suspects responsible for today's blast got into the taxi van in Tel Aviv. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Israel's deputy defence minister Ephraim Sneh said he believed the explosion was set off by Palestinian militants, possibly activists of the Islamic militant group Hamas or Islamic Jihad. Mr Sneh held Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat responsible for the blast. ""As long as activists of Hamas and the Jihad are walking around free in the West Bank and Gaza, the responsibility is of those who let them walk around freely,"" Mr Sneh said. ""We see the Palestinian Authority as responsible for the situation."" Police also said the assailants were apparently Palestinians. The explosion went off shortly before 2 pm (noon GMT). Witness Ilan Zvuluni said he was a few car lengths behind the taxi van. ""I saw wounded people lying on road, a boy among them."" Soldiers treated some of the wounded, Mr Zvuluni said. Police said the van had been under surveillance since it left Tel Aviv, about 50 kms (31 miles) away. When the van approached the intersection, ""a police car blocked the path of the suspect car,"" said Bentsi Saar, police commander of northern Israel. ""Those sitting in the van, probably terrorists, set off the explosive device,"" Mr Saar said.

world/2001/may/30/usa.alqaida,Embassy bombers face execution after US court passes guilty verdicts,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/30/usa.alqaida,"Two men face the death penalty after being convicted yesterday of murdering 224 people when United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed three years ago, at the close of a trial in New York that gave an unprecedented insight into the workings of the world's most feared sponsor of terrorism, Osama bin Laden. Another two men were found guilty of being part of a conspiracy, headed by the Saudi millionaire, that culminated in the explosions. They were not accused of direct involvement in the attacks and face life in jail. Clara Aliganga, mother of one of the victims, said outside Manhattan federal court after the verdicts were announced: ""This doesn't erase the pain. I hope this will give a message to the terrorists that we will not take this lightly as Americans. ""Even though this is a victory it doesn't do anything for the pain that you carry in your heart, losing someone that you love."" Hearings start today to decide whether the death penalty will be imposed on 24-year-old Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27. Already questions were being raised last night about how the international community would respond to their executions. A court in South Africa has ruled that Mohamed should not have been extradited to the US without being assured he would not face death. And Peter Bergen, an expert on terrorism who is writing a book about Bin Laden, said: ""If you look at the four people convicted today, they were low to middle level. You've got a lower level tier, not the leaders."" After the bombings, American investigators did not have far to go to find Wadih el-Hage, the former Bin Laden aide found guilty of conspiracy and murder yesterday because, by then, El-Hage was working in a tyre-repair shop, and living with his wife and seven children in a working-class neighbourhood of Arlington, Texas. American agents had been monitoring him for more than two years, in Nairobi and Texas, and had interviewed him three times and tapped his phone lines. Still they were unable to do anything to stop the bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam on August 7 1998. A year before the attacks, American and Kenyan agents took books, papers and a laptop computer from his home and stopped him the same night at Nairobi airport. El-Hage conceded that he knew Bin Laden but said that he he was involved only in the Saudi Arabian's legitimate businesses, including an import-export firm and a charity, Help Africa People. It was not until five weeks after the bombing that the FBI arrested El-Hage in Texas, pointed in his direction by a man who had cut his ties with Bin Laden. The CIA and the National Security Agency, who bugged his phones, and the FBI, who interviewed him, could act no sooner because he and members of Bin Laden's al-Qaeda organisation used code words and pseudonyms and spoke cryptically, according to intelligence sources. Frontman ""Mr El-Hage has served as a frontman for Bin Laden organisations for years,"" prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald told a hearing at which the 40-year-old was denied bail. ""His role is to set up logistics, engage in coded correspondence, move money, give false stories. By his own admission, he was chosen by Bin Laden to work for him because he had a US passport and could travel more freely."" But Frank Ciluffo, a counter-terrorism expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC, said yesterday: ""Even though we may have an inkling and have a particular individual under surveillance doesn't mean we're going to get hard intelligence to provide exact warning of an imminent attack. ""How do we improve the signal-to-noise ratio when we've got hundreds of warnings every week? It's easy in retrospect to say we coulda, woulda, shoulda. He could have been somewhat aware that people were on to him, that he could have fed misinformation or he could have pushed the heat elsewhere. ""Al-Qaeda is not a real hierarchical organisation. Apart from the person at the top it's rather loosely affiliated. When you bring down one link you don't get the whole structure."" George Tenet, the CIA director, told the Senate intelligence committee recently: ""The threat from terrorism is real, it is immediate and it is evolving. Osama bin Laden and his global network of lieutenants and associates remain the most immediate and serious threat."" The US believes it has particular reason to pay attention to this threat in its role as what the attorney general, John Ashcroft, calls the international terrorist's target of choice. ""Americans comprise only about 5% of the world's population,"" he said recently. ""However, according to state department statistics, during the decade of the 90s, 36% of all worldwide terrorist acts were directed against US interests."" The US has been considering for the past five years a smash and grab raid to seize the 43-year-old Bin Laden, who is thought to have inherited $250m and whose stated aim is to drive 6,000 US military personnel from the country of his birth, home to Islam's two most sacred sites. The FBI has him on its ""most wanted"" list and is offering $5m for information leading to his conviction. And the United Nations has imposed sanctions on Afghanistan, the country that harbours Bin Laden, who is suspected also of having been behind the attack on the USS Cole last October that killed 17 US sailors in Yemen. Star witness The Taliban, Afghanistan's rulers, say that the US has proved nothing against Bin Laden and that he will not be given up for trial in a non-Islamic country, leaving al-Qaeda (or the Base) beyond the reach of retribution. How it operates was detailed during the trial by the US government's star witness, known until the day he appeared in court as CS-1, and thereafter as 38-year-old Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl, in blue denims and an open-necked white shirt. At the apex of the organisation is Bin Laden and beneath him a group of about 12 trusted aides experienced in jihads, or holy wars. Then there are the committees: the military arm responsible for training and buying weapons; the Islamic study division to rule on religious law; the finance wing, overseeing corporate holdings and a travel office; and the media body, headed by a man nicknamed Reuter, publishing the newspaper Nashrat al Akhbar. A series of companies supports al-Qaeda's activities: Wasi al-Aqiq, the umbrella firm operating in Sudan; Taba Investment, trading in currencies; Ladin International, an import-export company; Hijra Construction, building roads and bridges; and Themar Al-Mubaraka, growing sesame seeds, peanuts and white corn on a farm in Sudan, used also for weapons and explosives training. Mr Al-Fadl said that he was the third person to swear allegiance, or bayat , to the group and that he served as its paymaster. He had taken part in an attempt to buy uranium for $1.5m because Bin Laden wanted to build a nuclear weapon, though he did not know if the deal ever went through. He had also taken money to other groups waging jihad, including a consignment of $100,000 to one in Eritrea, and otherwise worked in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Sudan. But the picture of a focused international terror conspiracy is distorted by human frailty. Mr al-Fadl felt he was underpaid and stole $110,000 from al-Qaeda; after he was discovered, a meeting with Bin Laden drove him into the arms of the United States and a witness protection scheme five years ago. Another man took the same course after he was denied $500 for his wife to have a caesarean section when Bin Laden said that the organisation needed to save money. The organisation, which encouraged members to shave their beards to avoid suspicion at airports, advised the faithful to affect a taste for cigarettes and cologne in the belief that this would appeal to women. And when al-Qaeda moved to Sudan it was not for any particular ideological purpose but rather because it had nothing much to do in Afghanistan after the Russians had gone. Once on a Bin Laden-owned farm in southern Sudan, Mr al-Fadl was arrested when a bomb went off and the neighbours complained to the police.

world/2001/may/11/israel,Israel rockets key Palestinian sites,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/11/israel,"Israel took revenge yesterday for the murder of two Romanian workers and two teenage Jewish settlers, with rocket strikes on key installations of the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, in Gaza City. A security compound suffered the worst damage, but an office belonging to Fatah, Mr Arafat's faction within the Palestinian Liberation Organisation responsible for much of the shooting, was also hit. The retaliation came after two Romanian farm workers employed by the Israelis to repair a border security fence were killed by a roadside bomb. The previous day, two Israeli teenagers had been brutally murdered. Hospital officials in Gaza said at least 20 people were injured, five of them seriously, in the rocket strikes. The Palestinian planning minister, Nabil Shaath, said Israel had declared a ""war of terror"" against the Palestinians. The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, referring to the rockets, said: ""This strategy will continue until the Palestinian violence stops."" Lieutenant Colonel Olivier Rafowicz, a spokesman for the Israeli army, said the rocket strike was ""a self-defence action by Israel in response to many terrorist attacks over the last few days"". A witness said the Israelis fired four or five missiles. A sprawling police compound, with a prison holding 300 common criminals and political prisoners, took the brunt of the attack. The strike was primarily in response to the killing of the two Romanians, part of a lar-ger workforce imported by Israel. They had been working on a fence near the Kissufim junction on the border between Israel and Gaza, a highly militarised area that Israel regards as vital for the protection of Jewish settlers. Hours earlier, the Israeli army had carried out a raid into Palestinian territory in Gaza, the kind of incursion that until recently had been almost unthinkable under international law but which has become a daily event. A police station and six houses were bulldozed. At the same time, the former Israeli minister, Yossi Beilin, who helped to shape the Oslo peace agreement in 1993, met Mr Arafat in Gaza. Israeli MPs from the leftwing Meretz party made a similar visit. Mr Beilin, who has been criticised by the right for seeing the Palestinian leader, said that negotiations were the only way to prevent the nightmare that saw children being killed. He is keen to explore linking a freeze on settlements with a ceasefire. One of the MPs, Mossi Raz, said: ""We have to make every effort to reach a ceasefire now, because children are being killed on both sides."" Mr Arafat told them that he was keen to resume talks with Israel at any level. The key is the future of Jewish settlements on the West Bank and Gaza, the cause of much of the friction. Mr Sharon is under foreign pressure to freeze expansion. In an extraordinary climbdown yesterday, Mr Sharon slashed planned spending on the settlers. But his office insisted that he had not caved in to Washington. He had been planning to spend $350m (£245m) over the next five years but this would be cut to $150m, Israeli army radio said. Mr Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, confirmed yesterday that the amount would be relatively small, compared with earlier quotes, and would be ""exclusively for protecting the settlers against Palestinian attacks"". But the cabinet secretary, Gideon Saar, denied that Mr Sharon would give in to pressure, and said the earlier figures had been unfounded.

world/2001/jun/02/israel,Israel mourns loss of an 'honest man',World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/02/israel,"The last time Faisal Husseini led marchers to the Israeli army checkpoint guarding the entrance to Jerusalem he was driven back by great clouds of teargas. Yesterday as his coffin, draped in the Palestinian colours, was carried along in a sea of mourners, the Israelis retreated and the crowds surged straight through. To the tens of thousands of people who accompanied the most senior Palestinian figure in Jerusalem on his final journey, it was a day not only for sorrow but for a show of strength. Husseini, 60, died on Thursday of a heart attack during a visit to Kuwait. As a brass band accompanied the cortege through the streets of Arab East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since the 1967 war, normal life came to a complete halt. Shops were shuttered for three days of mourning. Old men in spotless white headdresses and matrons with large golden crosses streamed into the streets, and Palestinian youths scaled the battlements of the old city to hoist the national flag. Ordinarily, that act would lead to immediate arrest by the Israeli police, but in acknowledgement of Husseini's following among his fellow Jerusalemites, the security forces hung back yesterday. They left it to the activists of the Fatah movement to police the crowds, removing the possibility of a confrontation inside the city walls. As befitting the scion of an aristocratic Palestinian family and a lifelong PLO activist, Husseini's was a hero's funeral. Brought from Amman to the West Bank town of Ramallah by helicopter, his coffin was carried on the shoulders of eight Palestinian security officers to a ceremony presided over by Yasser Arafat. ""To heaven, you, the beloved of martyrs,"" the Palestinian leader said. Husseini was laid to rest in the small cemetery of the Noble Sanctuary, the Muslim shrine at the heart of the walled city. He was buried beside his father, who died a hero for an earlier generation, commanding Palestinian forces in the battle for Jerusalem in 1948. Husseini's battles were more complicated. The unofficial mayor of east Jerusalem, he spent his last 30 years resisting Israeli efforts to erase the Palestinian presence in the city. A fixture at protests during the past eight months of uprising - unlike Mr Arafat, who is often abroad at times of unrest - he was regularly manhandled by police. But he spent the past 10 years reaching out to the Israeli left, and promoting the idea of a shared Jerusalem to his own people, despite opposition from some Palestinian quarters. Both strands of his life came together yesterday at Orient House, the elegant mansion he transformed from a family-owned hotel into the hub of Palestinian public life, where he was eulogised by friends - Jewish and Arab. ""He was 60 years old. He spent 45 years working for peace. How can you replace a man like that?"" said Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian planning minister. ""It was not just a question of calming the intifada. It consisted of a policy of peace and non-violence."" A few steps away in the throng who waited for hours in the baking afternoon heat for the coffin to arrive, the veteran Israeli peace activist Uri Avnery said Husseini's legacy remained that of a man who stood by his people. ""What made him important was that he was a man who took part in the ordinary problems of the people of Jerusalem,"" Mr Avnery said. ""He devoted maybe 16 hours of every day to people's personal problems. He was not just a politician making a speech."" Some of those noble sentiments were overcome by the crush that greeted the coffin when it arrived, strewn with baby pink carnations. Despite Hussein's mission of reconciliation, the crowds occasionally interrupted their chants of ""Faisal, our beloved"" to shout ""O, Jews, be aware. The armies of Mohammed are going to return."" But amid the anger and the angst, there was a prevailing sense of loss yesterday. ""Everybody is sad because he was a good man,"" said Mohammed Abu Maizer, 67, a retired caretaker at the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. ""He was honest.""

world/2001/apr/02/worlddispatch.annemcilroy,Police give Hell's Angels hell,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/02/worlddispatch.annemcilroy,"In the biggest operation of its kind in Canadian history, 2,000 police officers raided the bunkers and homes of violent biker gangs in Quebec this week, arresting 120 people. Biker gangs have terrorised the French-speaking province for years, thumbing their noses at the authorities. The police, however, claim they have lacked the resources or legislative power to deal with the Hell's Angels, Evil Ones, Rock Machine and other gangs who have turned residential neighbourhoods into violent fiefdoms. A six-year war between the Hell's Angels and their Rock Machine rivals has claimed more than 160 lives, including that of an 11-year-old boy killed when a bomb exploded near his Montreal home as he played outside. Another 170 have escaped assassination, including a Montreal crime journalist who was shot and wounded in a car park on his way to work. This week's early morning raids may mark a turning point. Police say the massive dragnet operation was a major blow to Hell's Angels, the most powerful biker gang in the country. The arrests followed a three-year investigation. Police were taking no chances with the detainees. The 87 suspects arrested in Montreal made their first court appearance by video link from prison, where extra guards were hired to deal with the influx of bikers. There are an estimated 250 full-fledged Hell's Angels in Canada, and as many as 3,000 associates. While not all were arrested, many of the most powerful figures are now in jail. Hell's Angels control a sizeable share of the country's drug trade, with highly paid lawyers and investment advisers handling their affairs. They are major players in organised crime and are involved in a wide range of underworld activity, from prostitution and the forced overworking of strippers to the robbing of elderly people through telemarketing scams. Quebec has suffered from their reign of terror more than any other province, but bikers are active from coast and coast, even in the Arctic. They have infiltrated the police, and copies of police intelligence reports were found in the possession of suspects arrested in the past. The most feared Hell's Angel is Maurice (Mom) Boucher, whose chubby bespectacled image is as familiar to Quebeckers as the faces of pop stars and politicians. After he was acquitted in 1998 of ordering the murder of two prison guards, following the disappearance and deaths of witnesses, Boucher tore out of the courthouse, racing through a red light in a show of defiance. During last week's raid, Boucher was in prison on charges of murder, but police have charged him with an additional 13 counts of first-degree murder and three counts of attempted murder. He was in prison when two or more of the murders were carried out. The bikers arrested in the raids have chosen trial by jury, which could prove difficult. Prosecutors fear that potential jurors will try to evade jury duty for fear of retribution.

world/2001/may/31/september11.usa,Bin Laden bombers: execution decision,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/31/september11.usa,"Members of the jury who will decide whether two men should live or die - after being convicted of murdering 224 people in east Africa by bombing US embassies there - are in favour of the death penalty. The jury in Manhattan started hearing arguments yesterday in the death penalty phase of the trials of Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 24, and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27. It is likely to be up to a month before decisions are reached on Owhali, who helped to deliver the bomb in Nairobi, and Mohamed, who ground explosives for the device in Dar es Salaam. They went off, separated by about 10 minutes, on August 7 1998. Jurists were asked to answer questions about their attitudes towards the death penalty before the trial started three and a half months ago. Using a scale from one to 10, with one meaning strongly opposed to execution, most replied with ratings of five, six or seven. Only one responded with a two. ""I am not a proponent of the death penalty,"" this juror wrote. ""I believe that a solution for protecting society is a complex matter and that the death penalty serves as one of its solutions but think that alternatives should be pursued on an ongoing basis."" Speaking for the prosecution, Patrick Fitzgerald told the jury yesterday: ""Each of you will be convinced in the end that the only punishment that fits the crime is the death penalty."" Survivors of the bombings are expected to be called to give evidence, which lawyers for the two men will try to counter by saying that their clients' roles were minimal. While US embassies were the targets, almost all those killed were Africans. Two other men found guilty of being part of a conspiracy by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born millionaire who is a leading sponsor of terrorism, face life sentences. They were not accused of direct involvement in the blasts. A representative of the ruling Taliban of Afghanistan, where Bin Laden is based, said yesterday that there was no question of giving him up. ""We are not defending Osama bin Laden, we are defending our principles,"" said Sayed Rahmatullah Hashimi. ""We don't condone the terrorist attacks on Kenya and Tanzania but we have not been given any evidence by the US. We don't see any difference between the terrorist attacks by the US on Afghanistan in 1998 and the attacks in Kenya and Dar es Salaam."" The US launched retaliatory strikes two weeks after the embassy bombings. ""The only difference is that the US attacks were more technologically advanced,"" Mr Hashimi said. ""Both killed civilians, 19 innocent civilians died in the attack on Afghanistan."" The Taliban had hinted that they might hand Bin Laden over for trial in a third country before a panel of Islamic jurists. But their spiritual leader, Mullah Omar, dropped that idea three months ago, after the UN imposed added sanctions on Afghanistan. The four convictions in the federal court in New York are only the opening of the US government's legal assault on Bin Laden. Another 18 people have been charged with being part of a conspiracy to kill Americans around the world. One goes on trial in New York in July accused of conspiracy and attempting to murder a prison guard, another has pleaded guilty and has yet to be sentenced, and three more are trying to avoid extradition from Britain. The remaining 13, including Bin Laden, are at large. An Algerian man found guilty last month of terrorist conspiracy was understood yesterday to have confessed that Los Angeles international airport was his target. Ahmed Ressam, 33, said to be a member of a group in Montreal with links to Bin Laden, is thought to be co-operating with investigators in the hope of winning a reduction in the 140-year sentence he might face otherwise. Mr Ressam was arrested in December 1999 as he drove off a ferry from Canada in a car containing about 60kg of explosives. He is expected to testify at the trial next month of another man accused of plotting to blow up US targets on or about New Year's Day 2000.",2001-05-31T15:31:12Z,"{'polarity': 0.04575448361162648, 'subjectivity': 0.5062059369202226}",0.5062059369202226
world/2001/may/07/usa.iantraynor,Bush threatens to slash spending on nuclear safety aid to Russia,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/07/usa.iantraynor,"The Bush administration is planning to slash spending on nuclear safety projects in Russia, raising fears that slacker controls on the porous Russian nuclear industry could bring an upsurge in the trafficking of radioactive materials. Throughout the 1990s the US spent billions of dollars on various programmes in Russia aimed at securing nuclear stockpiles against theft, decommissioning weapons-grade uranium and plutonium or converting it for civilian use, and retraining and paying Russian nuclear scientists in order to discourage them from taking their expertise elsewhere. The policy has been widely seen as one of the few relatively successful aid programmes to Russia and the Clinton administration had signalled a 50% increase in funds this year for the projects run mainly by the Pentagon and the US Department of Energy. But White House budget plans from the Bush team have scrapped the proposed increases and instead cut the $800m (£571m) allocated to the energy department by around $100m or more than 12%. ""It seems that some projects will need to be scrapped,"" said Igor Kudrik, a Russian expert on his country's nuclear industry at the Bellona environmental watchdog in Norway. The Republicans came to office in Washington fiercely critical of what they viewed as the Clinton government's failed economic and aid policies towards Russia. The proposed nuclear safety cuts are the first concrete evidence of reduced spending on Russia, though US and Russian experts predict the cuts will encounter strong resistance in Congress. ""There are prominent people in Washington, including Republicans, who want to restore and expand the spending, arguing that the nuclear problem is a threat to the US and not a favour to Russia,"" said Sergei Rogov, Moscow's top expert on the US. Indeed, a recent US government sponsored report recommended that up to $30bn be spent on containing the Russian proliferation risk over the next decade. Instead, under the Bush plans, experts say, key programmes could be eliminated, hastening a Russian brain drain and making it more tempting for Russian nuclear physicists to ply their trade in countries Washington views as rogue states. A billion-dollar scheme to decommission 68 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium, agreed by Presidents Clinton and Vladimir Putin in Moscow last year, is likely to be halted by the Bush administration, said Mr Kudrik. A separate project promoting the development of hi-tech enterprises and retraining Russian nuclear scientists to work in them could also go. More than 2,000 Russian nuclear scientists are employed in such schemes. Employment is on offer from such US bugbears as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. In the eight years since the US energy department inaugurated its nuclear containment projects in the former Soviet Union, new security systems have been installed at 113 sites. But this is a gargantuan work in progress, securing a mere fraction of weapons-grade material regarded as risky across Russia. Apart from planning to cut the nuclear safety funding, the US is also threatening to suspend most other aid to Russia if it concludes that Russian sales of nuclear technology for power plants in Iran are helping the country build a nuclear bomb. Last week the US state department put Iran at the top of its league table of countries sponsoring terrorism. ""American officials are convinced both that Iran plans to use that reactor to develop nuclear weapons, and that Iran's possession of nuclear weapons threatens US national security and that of its vital allies,"" Celeste Wallander of the US Council on Foreign Relations wrote in an analysis last month of the Bush administration's policies on Russia. But in the bout of tension between the Bush and Putin governments, says Mr Rogov, the Russians are pushing ahead with the Iranian contracts because they have concluded that there will be no reward from the West for good behaviour. ""We're damned if we do, and damned if we don't,"" he added.",2001-05-07T00:32:01Z,"{'polarity': 0.09359925788497216, 'subjectivity': 0.3235621521335807}",0.3235621521335807

The image of the Palestinians' most prominent woman - and eloquent defender - at the frontline of the protests against Israel's siege of Bir Zeit university, near the West Bank city of Ramallah, has at last drawn world attention to nearly six months of systematic restriction on civilian movement that has destroyed the economy, and caused widespread suffering. The trenches and earth barriers that went up around Bir Zeit at the weekend marked the first tangible display of how Ariel Sharon intends to end a Palestinian uprising, and restore a sense of security to his own people. But as EU and American condemnation of Israel's tightened siege made evident yesterday, such drastic measures are not internationally acceptable. The criticism has so shaken the Israeli army that it has partially relaxed its siege. The commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank, Brigadier General Benny Gantz, told reporters that the barriers went up because the army had received threats of a car bomb being plotted by two dozen Fatah militia field commanders living inside Ramallah. But a day after stationing an armoured personnel carrier at the southern entrance to an area with a population of more than 200,000, the army claimed it had foiled the attack. Other towns in the West Bank have been penned in for months. In the old city of Hebron 40,000 Palestinians have been under almost constant curfew so that the army can protect the 200 Jewish settlers living in their midst. Other towns - such as Nablus - are accessible only by a dirt road through the mountains, and heaps of earth and concrete barriers have blocked all entry points to some West Bank villages. At least 10 Palestinians have died in the last six months because Israeli soldiers blocked ambulances at military checkpoints or because they were unable to reach hospitals, the director of the Palestinian medical relief committee, Mustafa Barghouti, said. Israel terms these measures as ""internal closure"". For the Palestinians, Israeli restrictions are evidence that they remain under military occupation, six years after the arrival of self-rule. As Monday's demonstration at Bir Zeit university shows, middle class and educated Palestinians who stayed away from the stone-throwing protests at the start of the intifada are beginning to mobilise against Israel's siege. Mr Sharon knows that it is not physically possible to separate Israel from the Palestinians, and that the economy of the Jewish state does not function without cheap Palestinian labour. But such restrictions are a signal to an anxious domestic audience that the old warrior remains as tough as ever.

world/2001/mar/03/israel,Jericho under siege once more,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/03/israel,"More than 3,000 years after Joshua reputedly brought the walls of Jericho tumbling down with a mighty blast of his trumpet, the town is under siege once more. The Israeli army has encircled the town with an 11 mile (18km) trench in the desert sand, turning this sleepy oasis into a virtual prison for its 33,000 inhabitants. Two metres deep and almost as wide, it snakes along route 90, the main artery through the Jordan river valley, before turning west to seal off the town from the south. There is now only one way out of the ancient town - unless residents resort to hiking through the forbidding mountains that guard the northern and western approaches to Jericho - a single road dominated by an Israeli army checkpoint that opens and closes, Palestinians say, at the whim of Israeli soldiers. ""If they close the checkpoint, not even a fly can enter the town,"" said Adham Taher, a bulldozer driver. Israeli diggers began gouging out the trench a month ago, largely to protect Jewish motorists using the strategic route 90, one of only two roads linking central Israel to northern Galilee. Although Jericho has been the quietest town in the West Bank during the five-month uprising, an Israeli army spokesman said yesterday that sporadic shooting at the road by Palestinian gunmen was intolerable. He denied the trench represented a form of collective punishment. ""The extreme situation here is that Palestinian gunmen are preventing Israelis from having a normal life,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Olivier Rafowicz. ""No one in the world can put up with shooting. Even if one bullet is fired during the day, or during the night, and another after one week, or 10 days, it prevents people from having a normal life, and in this specific case, we are talking about a vital road."" The siege has devastated the town's economy, which once relied on punters at the region's only legal casino, and tourists visiting its ancient ruins. Elsewhere in the West Bank yesterday a Palestinian boy, aged nine, was shot dead by Israeli soldiers outside his home in the Ramallah area. Another Palestinian was shot dead in the Gaza Strip. Palestinians said the 40-year-old had learning difficulties. The Israeli army said he had been trying to plant a bomb on a main road. According to the official army magazine, Bamahane, there are plans to dig trenches around other towns in the West Bank, enabling the military to tighten the noose around Palestinian population centres without having to deploy additional soldiers.",2001-03-03T02:18:30Z,"{'polarity': 0.06735449735449733, 'subjectivity': 0.44661375661375674}",0.44661375661375674
world/2001/apr/10/lockerbie.nelsonmandela,Mandela questions Lockerbie verdict,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/10/lockerbie.nelsonmandela,"Nelson Mandela has said he will present Tony Blair with fresh evidence supposedly clearing the Libyan intelligence officer jailed for the Lockerbie bombing. The move follows a meeting with the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, and with the family of the imprisoned terrorist, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi,, in Tripoli on Sunday. The former South African president is also expected to press Mr Blair to lift the remaining sanctions against Libya. ""I don't promise anything, but the leader [Colonel Gadafy] informed me of facts which I did not know and I will visit Britain soon to discuss this case with its prime minister. But I promise that I will spare no effort to achieve positive results,"" Mr Mandela said yesterday at the end of his one-day visit to the Libyan capital. Mr Mandela, who has previously said he trusted Col Gadafy ""without reservation"", did not reveal the new evidence or specifically say he was convinced by it. The former South African president is already scheduled to meet Mr Blair in London on April 28. Megrahi was jailed for life in January by a Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands for planting the bomb on the PanAm flight that killed 270 people in 1988. Two years ago as South Africa's president, Mr Mandela played a crucial role along with Saudi Arabia in breaking the international deadlock over the Lockerbie bombing when he helped persuade Col Gadafy to surrender Megrahi and his co-accused, Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah, for trial on neutral ground. Mr Fhimah was acquitted by the court. In February, Mr Mandela accused London and Washington of reneging on the agreement by imposing fresh conditions for the complete lifting of United Nations sanctions against Libya which have so far only been suspended. Britain and the US say sanctions should only be scrapped when Tripoli admits official responsibility for the destruction of PanAm 103 and pays compensation to the families of the victims. ""We had got certain guarantees, one of the most important [being] that if Libya delivered the suspects, the sanctions would be lifted. Not suspended, lifted,"" Mr Mandela said at the time. ""We expected that the west would honour its undertaking. Unfortunately, that was not done."" Mr Mandela also said he expected Britain to abide by an agreement to allow the UN a role in overseeing Megrahi's imprisonment. Libya has repeatedly denied responsibility for the bombing and claims that the court that jailed Megrahi was acting under political pressure from Washington and London. After the verdict, Col Gadafy promised to reveal evidence that would prove Megrahi's innocence and leave the Scottish judges with three choices - suicide, resignation or exposing ""the truth"". But the Libyan leader has yet to provide the promised proof. Mr Mandela has not been afraid to side with Col Gadafy before on numerous occasions despite criticism from western governments which regard the Libyan government as a terrorist regime. Col Gadafy was a consistent supporter of the African National Congress when it was banned in South Africa and most western governments were soft on the apartheid regime. Mr Mandela has accused the Libyan leader's critics of hypocrisy and said he would not abandon Col Gadafy or other controversial friends such as Fidel Castro.",2001-04-10T02:09:33Z,"{'polarity': 0.04827717327717327, 'subjectivity': 0.4125160875160875}",0.4125160875160875
world/2001/apr/06/worlddispatch.rorymccarthy,Religion and violence on Pakistan's streets,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/06/worlddispatch.rorymccarthy,"The crowd cleared and a group of men, naked from the waist up, stepped forward and began beating their chests. As the chanting grew louder, they unwrapped bundles of steel knives attached to chains and began beating themselves on their backs, shouting ""Hussain, Hussain"". The blood-soaked ceremony is an annual ritual for Shia Muslims across the world, but in Pakistan this year it comes at a time of renewed sectarian tension. In a string of violent outbreaks between the Sunni community and the minority Shias - who make up 20% of Pakistan's 140m population - more than 50 people have been killed in the past two months. In Karachi on Wednesday, a bus driver found a bomb under his front seat and managed to defuse it. A Shia procession was due to pass by minutes later. Just 24 hours earlier, a former leader of a Shia Muslim group was shot dead by gunmen on a motorbike, near Multan, in the centre of the country. Reports say that there are up to 10,000 trained sectarian terrorists in Pakistan, supplied with arms from caches in mosques across the country. Riot police and heavily armed soldiers are now patrolling Rawalpindi and other cities across the country in a bid to prevent further attacks. In Lahore alone, 10,000 soldiers were on duty for the Shia procession - the country's biggest. The procession of mourners dressed in black shalwar kameez suits commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Hussain, the grandson of the prophet Mohammad, who died in 680AD in Karbala, in modern-day Iraq. The Ashura ceremony is the culmination of 10 days of mourning in Muharram, the first month of the Muslim year. But for all the recent upsurge in violence, most in the crowd at Rawalpindi appeared unconcerned by the threat. ""This day is most sacred for us. We are ready to die for this day,"" said Ahmed Ali, a 26-year-old web page designer from Islamabad. ""Things are becoming difficult now. The other sects are very organised and they think if they kill us they will go straight to heaven. But I don't think most people in Pakistan agree with them. For the past 50 years, we have lived peacefully in Pakistan. Why can't that continue?"" As the men beat deep cuts into their backs, women stood on the side of the road, dressed in black veils, beating their chests with the rest of the crowd. At one point, a white horse - signifying that which Hussain rode in battle - was led into the centre of the crowd, and hands reached out to touch the animal. Many of the men, already carrying scars on their backs from last year, came away with bloody wounds needing medical treatment. The knives ranged in size from just a few inches long to over a foot, and several young boys had joined in the self-flagellation. Every few minutes, when a mourner's injuries appeared to become too serious, the crowd would push forward and wrestle the blades from his hand. Across the border in Afghanistan, the hardline Sunni Muslim Taliban this week allowed Shias - again in the minority - to mark Ashura for the first time since they seized power nearly five years ago. Many of Pakistan's most wanted Sunni sectarian terrorists are believed to be in hiding in Afghanistan, protected by their close links to the Taliban.

news/2001/jun/05/guardianobituaries.zimbabwe,Obituary: Chenjerai Hunzvi,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jun/05/guardianobituaries.zimbabwe,"The man who became synonymous with Zimbabwe's recent breakdown in the rule of law, war veterans' leader Chenjerai ""Hitler"" Hunzvi, has died aged 51. His family in the Mashonaland East village of Chiminya must have had a premonition of his notorious future when they gave him his first name, which in Shona means ""beware"". He took the nom de guerre of ""Hitler"" when he joined the struggle against minority white rule in Rhodesia. Hunzvi first came to prominence when he was arrested at the age of 16 for supporting the nationalist struggle. On release, he escaped the country to join the liberation forces. He was judged to be bright, and was sent to study in eastern Europe - to Romania, where he became fluent in French and Romanian, and then to Poland. In 1979, he attended the Lancaster House talks in London, where a ceasefire and constitution for Zimbabwe were negotiated. He then returned to Poland to continue his studies, and eventually qualified as a doctor; his second wife, with whom he had a son, was Polish. Two other marriages brought him four children. He returned home in 1990, and opened a medical practice in the Harare township of Budiriro. By 1995, Hunzvi was issuing declarations of disability, with which thousands of war veterans - including cabinet ministers and other high-ranking officials - claimed large payments from the government. On the strength of that scheme, he was elected chairman of the Zimbabwe Liberation War Veterans Association. He cannily converted the relatively inactive organisation into a political force to be reckoned with. Led by Hunzvi, the veterans demanded gratuities and pensions from President Robert Mugabe. They staged angry demonstrations, which pointedly criticised Mugabe until he agreed, in November 1997, to pay them Z$5bn. The money, which had not been included in the national budget, prompted a dramatic crash in the value of the Zimbabwe dollar, and the nation's economy has been in a downward spiral ever since. In 1999, Hunzvi appeared in court for allegedly embez zling Z$45m of the war veterans' funds, but the trial was repeatedly postponed: last year, the veterans association called him a ""shepherd turned wolf"". He also faced charges for fraudulently signing hundreds of the disability forms, including his own. Hunzvi gained greater prominence in March last year, when he led his veterans, and other supporters of Mugabe's Zanu-PF party, in a series of invasions of white-owned farms. He gloried in the violence inflicted: ""I am the biggest terrorist in Zimbabwe,"" he said repeatedly. During the campaign for the parliamentary elections last June, he travelled the country, inciting his followers to intimidate supporters of the opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Numerous witnesses identified Hunzvi as a member of the gangs who severely beat and tortured them. According to numerous reports, which have never been denied, scores of people were tortured in his Budiriro medical offices. Although Hunzvi was known for his diatribes against whites, the vast majority of his victims were black. In a campaign marked by violence, Hunzvi won election to parliament, but became infuriated when he was not awarded a cabinet post. He remained Mugabe's most potent weapon, however, and intensified his intimidation tactics in two subsequent byelections. Four opposition members of parliament have charged that Hunzvi threw a petrol bomb at them and ordered 60 men to beat them. Earlier this year, he commanded raids by militants on nearly 200 factories and businesses, in the name of mediating in labour disputes. Business managers were assaulted by militants who extorted money they claimed was compensation for unfair dismissal. Two weeks ago, Hunzvi was named by international human rights groups as a torturer who had inflicted ""mass psychological torture"" on thousands of Zimbabweans. By this time, Mugabe had issued a blanket amnesty for politically motivated crimes that allowed Hunzvi and his veterans to act with impunity. Hunzvi's collapse in Bulawayo on May 21 was attributed to suspected malaria; although no official cause of death was announced by the state news media, medical sources say that he died of Aids. Despite the fact that Zimbabwe's HIV/Aids infection rate is estimated at 35% of the 15-to-49 age group, denial of the disease is still strong. Few of the 100,000 Zimbabweans who will die of Aids this year will admit it. • Chenjerai 'Hitler' Hunzvi, politician, born October 23 1949; died June 4 2001",2001-06-05T00:13:15Z,"{'polarity': 0.04596861471861471, 'subjectivity': 0.33322510822510815}",0.33322510822510815
world/2001/mar/06/israel,Sharon: 'I have formed a government',World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/06/israel,"Israel's prime minister elect, Ariel Sharon, today told the country's parliament that he is ready to take power tomorrow after successfully forming a government of national unity. After several weeks of negotiations, Mr Sharon has lined up a broad-based ruling coalition including at least 70 members of the 120-seat parliament, or Knesset. He needs a majority of 61 votes when he presents his government for formal approval tomorrow. Mr Sharon has built the eight party coalition with the aim of giving his government a more moderate image and making it less susceptible to collapse in the fractious parliament. However, Palestinian militants have threatened to welcome Mr Sharon with an onslaught of bombings. On Sunday a Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up in the Israeli town of Netanya, killing three people and injuring 60 more. The coalition includes rightwing religious parties as well as the centre-left Labour party, which has led the drive for a peace deal with the Palestinians. Labour's elder statesman, Shimon Peres, will serve as foreign minister in Mr Sharon's government. The unwieldy collection is necessary to provide Israel with stability and a unified government during a time of crisis, Mr Sharon said. But the factions have widely divergent views on fundamental issues, such as how to deal with the Palestinians. While Mr Sharon faces the urgent task of halting the violence, he must also win approval for this year's budget before the end of the month, or his government will be dissolved, forcing new elections. The peace talks with the Palestinians broke off shortly before the February 6 ballot, and Mr Sharon has said negotiations will not resume until the violence comes to an end. He opposes the far-reaching compromises proposed by the former prime minister, Ehud Barak, and there appears little chance for a quick resumption of talks at present. The fighting, which broke out after Mr Sharon visited Jerusalem's most hotly disputed religious site last September, has claimed 423 lives, including 347 Palestinians, 57 Israeli Jews and 19 others. Mr Sharon has promised to restore security to Israel, but has not detailed how he plans to achieve this in the month since he won a landslide victory over Mr Barak. ""We will make every effort to achieve (peace), but the reality around us reminds us that the struggle for the land of Israel is not over,"" Mr Sharon said during a visit to northern Israel today. ""Our neighbours have recognised our military might, but have not yet recognised our right to the country.""

world/2001/jun/04/israel,Immigrants lose hope as they bury children,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/04/israel,"Yelena and Yulia Nelimov were teenage girls consumed by teenage ambitions: to dress nicely, to have a good time, and to spend as many weekends as possible at a seafront disco that was a magnet for young immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Yesterday, on the day nine graves were dug for nine consecutive funerals at a cemetery north of Tel Aviv, dazed friends and relatives eulogised the extraordinary closeness of the sisters - Yelena, 18, and Yulia, 16, - who were among the 19 young Israelis killed by the suicide bomb attack on Friday night. ""They spent all their time together,"" said Marina Shniper, 15, their cousin, who sometimes used to tag along. ""They loved life so much. I never saw them cry; they were always laughing."" But when the twin coffins draped in the Israeli flag were lowered into the ground there were screams of anguish as the Nelimovs' one remaining child, Alexei, was coaxed into reciting the unfamiliar prayer for the dead. The girls were regulars at the Water World disco on the Tel Aviv seafront. The disco, which played Russian pop songs in the heart of Tel Aviv, symbolised the existence of these young Russian immigrants straddling the boundaries of adulthood and mainstream Israeli life. Almost all those killed in the attack were from the former Soviet Union, members of an immigrant community vastly increased in the past 10 years to account for 1m of Israel's 6.3m citizens. Even before the bombing, the Palestinian uprising had claimed a disproportionate share of immigrants from this community, but this latest tragedy was too much too bear. ""I was in the Russian army, in the special forces, and I saw my comrades wounded. I know what that means,"" the Nelimovs' uncle, Vladimir Shniper, said. ""But that was the army. When it happens to children, there are no words to describe the horror."" Many at Yarkon cemetery yesterday said they were no longer sure their future lay in their adopted homeland. ""Now that I have seen what is happening here I have decided to leave for Canada,"" said Yuri Poltialov, 21. ""I don't see that we have a future here; this country has been here for more than 50 years, and all it has seen is war."" Arriving here as children with the promise of a better life and greater security, the young Russian immigrants watched their parents rebuild their lives from scratch, toiling at menial jobs, while the younger generation struggled to fit in. Like many of the dead, the Nelimovs were raised by a single parent: their father, who is not Jewish, stayed behind in Russia when the girls emigrated with their younger brother, mother, and grandmother six years ago. They went the same secondary school in Tel Aviv. ""Today I am at my fourth funeral,"" the principal, Avraham Benvinisti, said, ""and there are more to come."" Only minutes earlier he had stood over the grave of another pupil, Irina Nepomniashy, who arrived from Tashkent four years ago and was in the business stream at the Shevah-Mofet school. Friends say she was determined to make something of her life, to rise above the conditions that trapped her father in a factory job paying less than £500 a month. But her death brought an added cruelty. She was buried away from the other teenagers, shunned by the religious authorities because they did not consider her ritually Jewish. Her grave, heaped with bouquets and small memorial candles, stands in a cluster of oleander bushes, isolated even from the section of the graveyard reserved for the unknown dead, because the religious authorities only recognise Jews born of Jewish mothers, and Irina's mother, Raisa, is a Muslim. In the throes of their grief the Nepomniashy family did not have the reserves of strength to protest at the insult. They merely gave in to quiet grumbling after Raisa was carried from her only daughter's grave in the arms of two friends. A cousin, Alexander Nepomniashy, said the justice minister, Meir Shitreet, had promised the family that Irina would be buried with her classmates, but when they arrived at the cemetery other arrangements had been made. ""She lived here with everybody together, so she should have been buried with everyone together,"" Mr Nepomniashy said. ""As I see it now, Israel never really accepted her because it would not let her be buried like everybody else.""",2001-06-04T00:21:23Z,"{'polarity': 0.05003501400560224, 'subjectivity': 0.36396475256769373}",0.36396475256769373
world/2001/may/21/israel,Israel heading for disaster,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/21/israel,"Israel should stop using F-16 fighter-bombers to attack the Palestinians, the US vice-president, Dick Cheney, said yesterday. Asked in a television interview about Israel's use of the American-made warplanes, Mr Cheney warned: ""I think they should stop, both sides should stop, and think about where they are headed here, and recognise that down this road lies disaster."" Hours later Israeli tanks shelled the home of a Palestinian security chief who has frequently taken part in peace negotiations with the Jewish state, in an attack bound to sharpen criticism of Israel's use of inappropriate measures to snuff out the Palestinian intifada. The West Bank preventive security chief, Jibril Rajoub, was slightly wounded when his Ramallah home was hit by three tank shells as he lay asleep. The shelling will be hugely embarrassing for the army and Israel's hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon. Mr Cheney's comments called into question Israel's strategy of combating Palestinian guns, bombs and mortars with sophisticated and devastating weaponry - much of it supplied or paid for by the US. But he declined to say what, if anything, Washington would do to force Israel to keep the aircraft grounded. ""It's a very delicate situation,"" he said. Israel, which acquired the F-16s from the US for defensive purposes, has attracted scathing criticism both at home and abroad for using them against Palestinian towns as punishment for a suicide bomb attack by a Hamas activist that killed five Israelis in the seaside town of Netanya on Friday. At least 12 Palestinian policemen died in Israeli air raids on security compounds. Major General Giora Eiland, a spokesman for the army, said Israel needed the destructive force of the F-16s for targets too large for helicopter gun ships. ""The decision to use F-16s was not a strategic decision, rather it was a tactical decision _ We were looking for the best ammunition and in this specific case it was the F-16s,"" he said. ""It does not imply that from now on the only way we are going to deploy our aviation is by F-16s."" Earlier Mr Sharon threatened to unleash the full might of the military against the Palestinians. ""We will do everything necessary and use everything we have to protect Israeli citizens,"" he said in a newspaper interview published yesterday. The F-16 raids were described by the largest Israeli daily, Yedioth Ahronoth, as ""stupid"". ""Hi-tech language speaks of smart bombs,"" the paper said. ""The bombs dropped on Nablus and Ramallah were as stupid as can be. They were pointless. Does anyone believe that two F-16s over the West Bank can deter Islamic bombers and those who send them?"" Other Israeli papers saw the air strikes as ""a superfluous escalation"" and ""a grave political-strategic mistake"". Yesterday, as Mr Sharon met with his security cabinet, Israeli gunboats raked the Palestinian naval headquarters in Gaza with machine-gun fire, according to Palestinian witnesses. At least 10 Palestinians were injured by tank fire across the West Bank. Mr Sharon also came under criticism yesterday from Israel's Peace Now movement, which accused him of breaking a promise not to establish new Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Peace Now said Israel had set up at least 15 new settle ment sites in the West Bank since Mr Sharon came to power in March. Its report echoed Palestinian views that opposition to the settlements, which are illegal under international law, lies at the heart of the intifada. Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, warned that the situation ""might reach a point of no return _ What is happening will lead to a catastrophe and harm the interests of foreign powers in the region,"" he said, describing Israel's use of F-16 fighters as ""astonishing"".

world/2001/jun/09/mcveigh.usa,Diaries reveal McVeigh's goal,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/09/mcveigh.usa,"As Timothy McVeigh approaches his day of execution this Monday, he has been dieting so that he will look like a ""concentration camp victim"" in postmortem photographs, according to jail diaries kept by his fellow inmates on death row in Indiana. McVeigh's execution will be broadcast on closed-circuit television to about 300 survivors and relatives of victims in Oklahoma City. One fellow inmate and diarist, Paul Hammer, referred to the media event as ""Bloodstock"". The event may also be videotaped after a federal judge in Pittsburgh granted a request to this effect yesterday by lawyers in an unrelated death penalty case who want to use the filmed record to support their argument that state execution contravenes the constitution because it is cruel and unusal punishment. The Pittsburgh case involves Joseph Minerd, charged with rigging the pipe bomb that killed his former girlfriend and her daughter. Minerd was charged under the federal arson and bombing law that was also used to prosecute defendants including McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing. A McVeigh lawyer said his client had no objection to a video, but justice department officials are appealing against the Pittsburgh ruling, citing a federal regulation that prohibits photographic, visual or audio recording of executions. Light is thrown on the Oklahoma City bomber's state of mind and conditions in the federal death row buildings in the small Indiana town of Terre Haute by diary entries posted on a website that is called Death Row Speaks (www.deathrowspeaks.net). Jeff Paul, 24, who is facing the death penalty for robbing and shooting dead an 82-year-old man on a mountain path in Arkansas, observed in an entry dated May 25 that the security precautions around McVeigh had been stepped up, with waste paper from his cell being shredded. ""Apparently, a staff member was caught either smuggling things out of prison with his [McVeigh's] name on it or trying to sell some things of his on the internet. Tim [McVeigh] is not sure which but is interested in finding out,"" Paul wrote. ""They put him in a cell with constant video surveillance a while back and instituted a policy that anytime he comes out of his cell he'll have at least three officers present, on top of the handcuffs and chains."" Officials in charge at Terre Haute failed to return calls about the security precautions, but officials at the bureau of prisons said that they believed the Death Row Speaks diaries to be genuine. The diaries consist mainly of the inmates' personal reflections on their past and their jail conditions, but two of them, Paul and David Hammer, make occasional observations about their notorious prison mate. Paul reported that ""for a long time he [McVeigh] was on a vegetable diet that comes in a special tray. I asked him why and he said it was because he wanted to look like a concentration camp victim for the postmortem photos."" On May 30 he noted that McVeigh had started taking normal meals again, and Paul speculated this was because he believed his stay of execution, granted because of the belated discovery of evidence by the FBI, would last longer than the initial month, and that ""he knows he's going to be around to lose [weight]"" later. But on Thursday, a federal appeal court upheld a district judge's decision to reject McVeigh's request for an extended stay of execution, on the grounds that there was no doubt about his guilt. McVeigh, who has admitted bombing the Alfred P Murrah federal building on April 19 1995 - killing 168 people and injuring 500 - subsequently dropped his attempt to have the execution postponed. The web diaries do not record these most recent events, as they have to be posted by conventional mail to the website organisers, Julie and Simon Whyte in Dorset, England. Ms Whyte said yesterday that the three-month-old website was ""an opportunity for inmates to show that they are human beings, with feeling and emotions like the rest of us. It gives an insight into their lives and, by understanding what the inmates have been through, maybe we can start trying to concentrate on the cause of violent behaviour rather than continuously having to execute people and achieving nothing."" In another entry, Paul Hammer also wrote: ""My friend Tim is a troubled and misguided man. We disagree on most issues, but he is also a kind loving and caring person with a quick smile, keen wit and a sense of humour. I will miss him and I continue to pray for his soul.""",2001-06-08T23:28:56Z,"{'polarity': 0.013650793650793646, 'subjectivity': 0.3505731922398589}",0.3505731922398589
world/2001/feb/11/paulharris.theobserver,Saudi expat community rocked by arrests of Westerners,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/11/paulharris.theobserver,"Alexander Mitchell had an admission to make. 'I confirmly confess that I was ordered to carry out an explosion here in Riyadh, which took place on Friday the 17th of November, the year 2000.' The Scotsman squinted at the television autocue before continuing his statement, which was riddled with grammatical errors: 'The explosion was directed against Mr Christopher Rodway, who is a British nationality. I placed the explosive device under the driver's seat of Christopher's car.' Minutes earlier, Mitchell had arrived under heavy armed guard at the studios of Saudi national television in downtown Riyadh with Canadian William Sampson and Belgian Raaf Schifte. They were about to admit killing Rodway and blowing up another car in which three more Britons and an Irish woman were injured. But to observers, something appeared odd. Looking dazed and frightened, the trio sat separately behind a desk and used a pointer stick to show how they carried out the attacks. Mitchell said he had been ordered to use a remote control to carry out the bombing, but would not say who gave the instructions or why. The 46-year-old also used street maps to show the location of the victim's houses and the exact sites of the blasts. He would have known that, under Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islamic law, convicted murderers are beheaded, usually in public, to deter others. His friends were astonished. 'His words made no sense, especially saying he was commanded to carry out the attack. He was a jovial man about town, with fingers in a lot of pies but always good for a laugh,' said one. Another thought Mitchell looked drugged or was suffering from the effects of extreme fatigue. The authorities had hoped the arrests and confessions would lead to swift justice and put an end to speculation about the possibility that terrorists were active in this prosperous state. The authorities hoped that blaming infidels from the West would prove that the Saudis were a peaceful people. But the authorities were wrong. The country is buzzing with rumours about the decadent high life of the Western residents of 'Happy Valley', and dark mutterings about whether innocent men are to be put to death. It was a sunny day when the 4x4 car pulled up to a crossroads in the centre of Riyadh four months ago. Inside were Rodway, who worked in a hospital, and his wife, Jane. Seconds later an explosion tore through the vehicle, shattering the silence that usually hangs over the Saudi capital's streets on the Muslim holy day of prayer. A bomb had almost severed Rodway's leg. As frantic passers-by rushed to the scene and called the emergency services, it was clear his chances of survival were small. Later that evening Rodway died. Jane was lucky. She escaped with minor injuries. Five days later, on 22 November, a second car bomb went off. The targets this time were driving down Riyadh's old airport road. The blast injured all of them, with one, Mark Paine, requiring major surgery to save a leg. Panic spread rapidly through the expat community. Islamic terrorists were suspected as the attacks came soon after a suicide bombing that killed 17 US sailors in Yemen. Warnings were issued to check cars and a host of events on the usually busy expat social scene were hastily cancelled. When a third bomb exploded in the eastern city of Al Khobar, pressure on the Saudi police reached its peak. David Brown, a British Coca-Cola executive, lost an eye when a juice carton left on his car exploded in his face. Now terrified of having its international image damaged, the Saudis moved quickly. Mitchell and other Westerners were already known to the police for their past role in the illegal alcohol trade and were arrested on 17 December, along with six other foreigners, for drinks offences. But in pinning the crimes on Western suspects linked to the underground drinking industry, the Saudis lifted the lid on one of their best kept secrets - the decadent high life enjoyed by foreigners living there. Despite strict laws that include a ban on drink, drugs and women drivers - upheld by the Mutawwa'in religious police - it is possible to party around the clock in Saudi Arabia. Alcohol is freely available. Diplomats and their visitors used to rely on foreign embassies sneaking liquor into their compounds in diplomatic bags. But recently the scene has exploded into a fully-fledged industry, fuelled by smuggling over the long and porous desert border with Yemen. Other merchandise comes in from neighbouring Bahrain, where alchohol is legal. Most of it is brand-named and expensive: a bottle of malt whisky costs more than £125. There is also a thriving cottage industry in home-brewed beers, wines and spirits. Thousands of gallons are distilled inside the self-contained compounds in which most foreigners live and where makeshift bars are set up. Deliveries are usually made on a Friday, when most of the local population are at mosques praying. But the pubs are an open secret. They are bought and sold, have names such as Raffles and the Empire Club, regular discos and breweries in their backrooms. Mitchell once owned a bar called Celtic Corner, which had its own membership lists and a gymnasium. Last year he sold up to Rodway and Saudi police have seized on the transaction as a possible source of dispute between the two men. But it is not only Westerners who are living it up in the desert: the high life attracts the cream of Saudi society. Some are there for the drinks, others are there to make money. Saudi business relies heavily on patronage and, according to diplomatic sources, all the leading Western bootleggers have senior Saudi backers who take a slice of the illegal profits. 'Saudi is not like it used to be. You can get anything you want there if you are willing to pay for it, and some of the people hanging around these bars are very senior people. It is big money,' said Barry Jones, who lived for several years in Riyadh and worked in publishing. The parties are often wild. Many of the expat workers, from nurses to oilmen, are single. With money to spend and severe restrictions on public shows of decadence, what goes on behind closed doors is often hedonistic. One former resident joked last week that few marriages survived an extended stay in the country. According to former residents, drugs too are becoming part of the expat lifestyle, though they are not tolerated by the authorities. Marijuana, cocaine and even heroin are available to those willing to pay. The penalty for those caught trying to smuggle in drugs, usually 'mules' from countries such as Nigeria and Pakistan, is death. With such a vibrant market for illicit goods, Saudi police claim it was no surprise that turf wars would erupt now and then. The apparent involvement of three Westerners in the alcohol trade and the sale of illegal bars seemed to confirm that shady dealings would lead to trouble. Despite the arrests of Mitchell, Sampson and Schifte, the bombings continued. An explosion rocked the plush Euromarche mall in Riyadh on 10 January. The blast injured no one but destroyed a telephone booth and damaged a passing car. And it was this explosion that could lead police to those behind the previous bombings, including the explosions admitted by the three Western suspects. Saudi dissidents, speaking to The Observer, revealed last week that a note claiming responsibility for the Euromarché bombing was left at the scene. The note, which did not identify a specific group, warned of more and bigger attacks to come unless the Saudi government released political prisoners. The opposition groups are Islamic fundamentalists, appalled that so many Westerners have been allowed into a country which guards the holiest shrines of Islam. They want them out and the Saudi royal family along with them. Yet the government relies on foreign expertise. Almost 300,000 Europeans and North Americans work in the country. If opposition groups are proved to have been behind the Euromarché bombing, some observers believe that linking them to the other bombings will be irresistible. 'Most of the Islamic opposition people want to get foreigners out of the country. All these bombs have been targeted at foreigners,' said Said Aburish, a Middle East expert and author of a book on corruption in Saudi Arabia. Many of Saudi Arabia's small opposition groups take their inspiration from Osama bin Laden, who planned the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Ironically, the weapons and explosives used by these groups enter along the same routes used by alcohol smugglers - overland from Yemen. Raids by the police are common. The Observer has learnt that last November, after the first two bombings, more than 50 people linked to the opposition were arrested. 'The government knows it was jihadi (Islamic) groups behind all these four attacks. They just do not dare to admit it,' said Saad al-Faqih, head of the London-based Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, an opposition group campaigning for peaceful reform. Mindful of huge business interests in the country, Britain has played a careful diplomatic game, refusing to condemn outright the Saudi action in arresting Mitchell. But the trio face a long period of uncertainty while diplomats try to find a solution and avoid a trial that would almost certainly be held in secret. The men could escape death if Rodway's family accept 'blood money'. But Rodway's father, Jerry, has already called for his son's killers to be executed. Tory MP David Wilshire MP will this week table Commons questions to Foreign Secretary Robin Cook demanding stronger moves to protect Mitchell's rights. 'It would seem that the British Government is unwilling to kick up a fuss for fear of upsetting people who we do a lot of business with,' Wilshire said. Questions are also likely on why the men confessed. Human rights campaigners believe they were subjected to psychological torture. Locked up alone, denied food and threatened with abuse, a confession was inevitable, they claim. Eventually the men - exhausted, confused and terrified - were told to admit to the bombings. Meanwhile, the executioner's sword is being sharpened. Observers fear that could mean the truth may never be known.",2001-02-11T02:33:58Z,"{'polarity': 0.015160987916089977, 'subjectivity': 0.3875897477428092}",0.3875897477428092
world/2001/mar/17/chechnya.russia,3 die as Saudis storm hijack jet,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/17/chechnya.russia,"The hijack designed to bring the continuing war in Chechnya to the attention of the world ended in bloodshed yesterday as three people were killed when Saudi anti-terrorist troops stormed the Russian aeroplane to free more than 100 remaining passengers. One of the hijackers slit the throat of a female flight attendant as the Saudi soldiers burst into the plane. Saudi officials said the youngest hijacker had been shot dead in retaliation by the troops. A Turkish passenger was also killed in the crossfire and several others were injured. The decision to storm the plane came after consultation with officials in Moscow after a tense night of fractured negotiations. Several dozen heavily armed Saudi soldiers used wooden ladders to scale the side of the airliner and ordered the terrified passengers to run from the plane. Many of the hostages who had spent the night waiting to be released were manhandled face down on the tarmac as troops tried to separate the hijackers from their victims. ""Moscow had offered to rush an anti-terrorist unit to Riyadh, which the Saudis categorically refused,"" a Saudi official said. ""The assault was undertaken only by Saudi forces without help from any other party."" One Russian passenger said after being released: ""I saw three hijackers. They treated us well, but sometimes they threatened to blow up the plane. We were frightened and worried."" The three men were armed with knives and claimed to be carrying a bomb. The aircraft had been heading from Istanbul to Moscow on Thursday afternoon with 162 passengers and 12 crew on board when three hijackers forced their way into the cockpit and demanded that the plane be diverted to Syria or Egypt. Later the Vnukovo Airlines jet landed in the western Saudi Arabia town of Medina, where the men demanded that it be refuelled and requested to be allowed to continue to Afghanistan. About 40 women, children and elderly passengers were released as talks began. Another group managed to escape through the rear exit. As dawn broke, a red, green and white striped Chechen national flag was visible, draped outside the main door to the plane. The organiser of the operation was reported to be the former general and Chechen interior minister Aslanbek Arsayev, with his brother, Supian, and Supian's son. But Chechen sources denied this last night. During his time in power, Gen Arsayev promised to re-establish the rule of law amid mounting anarchy in the Chechen republic, with little success. He survived two assassination attempts, but stepped down in early 1999 citing ill health. He was wounded in fighting with Russian troops last year. It was not clear whether the operation was sanctioned by the Chechen leader, Aslan Maskhadov, or if it represented an independent initiative by another rebel faction. A Chechen rebel internet website quoted Mr Maskhadov as rejecting responsibility. ""Taking hostages and blackmail is not how we lead our struggle,"" he was quoted as stating. But Mohammed Al Atafyev, describing himself as Mr Maskhadov's representative in Jordan, said the attackers were working for the good of the Chechen republic in the face of Russian ""genocide"".",2001-03-17T01:24:57Z,"{'polarity': 0.00023712737127370648, 'subjectivity': 0.24986449864498642}",0.24986449864498642
world/2001/apr/17/israel4,Israel seizes Palestinian areas in Gaza Strip,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/17/israel4,"Israeli troops seized a Palestinian-controlled slice of the Gaza Strip early today - a first in seven months of fighting - and launched rockets against Palestinian security bases in retaliation for mortar fire on an Israeli town. A Palestinian policeman was killed and 36 people were hurt in the attack from the ground, air and sea - one of the most extensive Israeli military operations since September. Israeli troops also divided Gaza into three parts, barring north-south traffic in the crowded strip which is home to more than one million Palestinians, and closed the border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. Palestinian officials accused Israel of reoccupying the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, returning to the West Bank from a meeting with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, said the raid was a ""dirty Israeli ploy to end Palestinian resistance"", and that his people would keep fighting until they won independence. Israel said it had to respond after Palestinians fired mortars at the small Israeli working class town of Sderot. According to an army map, troops recaptured about 0.8 square miles in the northeastern part of the 140-square-mile Gaza Strip. An Israeli commander in the Gaza Strip, brigadier general Yair Naveh, said his troops would remain in the recaptured areas for ""days, weeks or months"" - as long as necessary to stop the mortar attacks. He said the army had no plans to remain there for good. Israel's strike began on Monday evening, with tanks and helicopters firing dozens of rockets at Palestinian police positions across the Gaza Strip. In the residential Rimal neighbourhood of Gaza City, rockets hit the headquarters of Palestinian police chief Ghazi Jabali, punching holes in the facade and ceiling. Hundreds of residents, including crying children, ran into the street after the first rockets struck. The incursion with ground troops began at around midnight on Monday. Palestinian medics carrying the body of a Palestinian policeman killed in the rocket attack ran in panic when they came under fire. The Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for the mortar attack on Sderot, a stronghold of Sharon's Likud party about 2.5 miles east of Beit Hanoun and about five miles from the sheep farm of the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, in the Negev Desert. No one was hurt. The Palestinians had fired dozens of mortars at Israeli targets in recent weeks, mainly Jewish settlements in Gaza. Israel also launched an air strike against Syria on Monday after an Israeli soldier was killed over the weekend in a rocket attack by Lebanese guerrillas. The Syrian foreign minister, Farouk a-Sharaa, said Israel was expanding the crisis and would ""pay a heavy price."" In Washington, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said today, before the occupation, that ""the president urges all parties to exercise restraint"". A 14-year-old Palestinian boy was killed this morning by Israeli fire near the Karni crossing between Gaza and Israel, Palestinian doctors said. It was not immediately clear what prompted the shooting. Since fighting erupted in late September, 473 people have been killed, including 390 Palestinians, 64 Israeli Jews and 19 others.

world/2001/jan/02/israel4,Arafat's last despairing bid for peace,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/02/israel4,"The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, is heading for Washington in what seems to be a last despairing bid to revive the Middle East peace process before president Bill Clinton steps down on January 20. The Oslo peace accord was the first and greatest diplomatic triumph of the Clinton presidency. Now, more than seven years on, it seems to be disintegrating in a welter of blood and harsh rhetoric. Arafat's spokesman said that the trip was ""a decisive visit at which the future of the peace process will be determined"". But the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, who has no immediate plans to follow Arafat to Washington, has accused the Palestinian leader of wasting time, and of not seriously seeking peace. The Palestinians, backed by Egypt, have asked for urgent clarification of the latest plan put forward by Washington for a final peace settlement. Israel has already accepted the outline plan, but with serious reservations. In an ominous further development, Barak - himself a former army chief of staff - has told Israeli military commanders to prepare for a worsening unrest, and possibly even a regional war. He said today: ""There is a greater possibility of a general deterioration, and the general command needs to be ready."" Israel has heaped all the blame for the last three months of bitter clashes on Arafat and the Palestinian leadership, even though, of the 357 people killed so far, just 40 have been Israelis. Public opinion in Israel has been inflamed by recent bomb explosions and by attacks on Jewish settlements on the West Bank. Polls suggest that Barak is doomed to lose the February 6 direct election for the prime ministership. His rival, hardline rightwinger Ariel Sharon, has said that he will order the bombing of Palestinian towns to stop the violence.

world/2001/may/07/israel,Israeli raid crosses line drawn by Oslo pact,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/07/israel,"Akram Atallah's middle son counted 13 tank shells on the first morning in his new home yesterday. The 14th tore through the red-tiled roof, leaving the three-storey building inches deep in water, soot and metal shards. Yesterday's assault on the Christian town of Beit Jala was the first invasion of Palestinian-ruled territory in the West Bank since these lands near Bethlehem were awarded to Yasser Arafat's control under the Oslo peace accords five years ago. The tanks roared in just before 8am, pushing several hundred metres into Palestinian land and pounding homes for several hours, as the Israeli government announced that it had freed the army's hand to crush the militias who have fired from here on a road which links Jerusalem to the illegal Jewish settlements to the south. A militiaman, Mohammed Abayat, was killed in the battle that erupted, and some 20 other Palestinians were hurt, including an 11-year-old girl who was hit in the eye, and a smaller boy whose arm was nearly severed by shrapnel. As clouds of acrid-smelling smoke rose above Beit Jala, designated under Oslo as Area A, or under full Palestinian control, the Israeli defence minister, Binyamin Ben Eliezer, said the army would no longer be bound by the divisions enshrined by the peace accords. ""In principle, I have approved any entry to Area A, if that is necessary to guard our security,"" he told reporters. The declaration follows several invasions of Palestinian-ruled areas of Gaza in the past few weeks. Their frequency has rendered such violations routine, and helped blunt international criticism. But there was immediate reaction from the EU yesterday. ""We immediately call on Israel to withdraw from Area A,"" its envoy, Miguel Moratinos, said during a visit to Gaza. The brief invasion of Beit Jala comes after several days of relative calm. But in the past Palestinian snipers have taken cover in the rocky hills to fire on Route 60, which leads to the southern Jewish settlements, or an illegal enclave abutting Jerusalem, built on land confiscated from Beit Jala. The Israeli army said the brief invasion was in retaliation for a shooting attack earlier yesterday. But Palestinian officials said the incursion, and Israel's assassination of an Islamic Jihad militant south of Beit Jala on Saturday, had sabotaged local efforts to rein in the militias, or tanzim, in advance of a ceasefire. ""The situation was coming under our control,"" said Ibrahim Ramadan, the chief of Palestinian preventative security in the Bethlehem district. ""For 10 days there was not a single bullet. We stopped because they said there would be a ceasefire agreement, so we told the tanzim: 'We will capture you if anyone shoots.' Nobody shot until yesterday when they killed that man."" Amid the recriminations, Mr Atallah could be sure of one thing. His £100,000 home was in ruins after his family had spent just one night there. ""The Israelis believe that the Palestinians don't deserve nice houses. Only the settlers should be able to build nice houses on the land they occupy from us,"" he said. When the first of the three shells to hit their home landed, Mr Atallah took his three sons to shelter under the central stairwell. As Shaban, nine, counted the incoming shells - 30 within earshot - his wife tried to calm the other boys by telling stories. On the other edge of Beit Jala, the tanks roared up the driveway of the al-Jundi family home, shelling it once and spraying it with machine-gun fire. The Israelis occupied the house, which has a commanding view of Route 60, for about five hours, thrusting the women and 10 children out into a firefight with militia men who left piles of bullet casings at the gate. Then the Israeli soldiers relented and let the al-Jundis shelter in their basement. Yesterday's surge in violence came as Israel's hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon, rejected a call from an international inquiry led by the former US senator, George Mitchell, to stop building Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Palestinians say the illegal settlements are at the core of the conflict.

world/2001/mar/19/worlddispatch.annemcilroy,Canada under fire as haven for terrorists,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/19/worlddispatch.annemcilroy,"Canada added to its growing reputation as a haven for terrorists and other criminals last week, amid serious revelations about the ease with which an alleged Y2K bomber got a passport using little more than a forged student card. Ahmed Ressam is on trial in Los Angeles for conspiracy to commit terrorism and smuggling unlicensed explosives. US officials suspect he was planning to blow up a major target in Seattle on New Year's Eve 2000. Last week, the jury heard how simple it was for Mr Ressam, an Algerian, to become Canadian Benni Noris. A Montreal student who has already pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud said he had no trouble applying for six passports on behalf on non-existent people. All it took to give Mr Ressam a squeaky clean new Canadian identity was a fake student card and a forged baptismal certificate. It appears that passport officials did not even do basic checks that would have verified whether his documents were indeed legitimate. Mr Ressam appears to have used his new passport to travel to Afghanistan in 1998, where US prosecutors allege he learned bomb-making skills at a training camp run by Osama bin Laden. He is the wealthy Saudi militant blamed by the US government for several acts of international terrorism, included the bombings of two US embassies in Africa in 1998. Mr Ressam came to Canada in 1994, claiming persecution in his native Algeria. Within a few months he had been charged with the first of several criminal theft offences but, when he failed to show up in court, Canadian police and immigration officials were unable to track him down. US prosecutors say he was part of a Montreal-based terrorist cell. A suspicious US border guard stopped Mr Ressam when he tried to enter the United States at Port Angeles, Washington, from Victoria, British Columbia on December 14 1999. In his trunk were enough explosives and components to make three powerful time bombs. Government officials are scrambling to show some sceptical US legislators pushing for tighter border controls that Canada is not a haven for criminals and terrorists whose aim is to do damage in the United States. It didn't help that last week also saw the Royal Canadian mounted police and the immigration department come under fire for taking more than two years to find an alleged Mafia hitman. The Italian government had requested that he be extradited from Canada to face trial at home. Gaetano Amodeo, who is accused of killings in Italy and Germany, enjoyed life in Montreal until January, even though the Italian government asked that he be arrested in 1999. During that time, his name twice appeared on his wife's application for permanent residency. It appears the immigration department didn't pass this information on to the police. Embarrassed government ministers will say only that Mr Amodeo could not be found until December of this year. It left them open to attack from opposition politicians, as they were unable to answer some pointed questions. ""Who is responsible for Canada being considered as the Club Med for international criminals, as an immigration sieve?"" demanded Bloc Québécois house leader Michel Gauthier.

world/2001/apr/13/israel1,Jewish pupils urged to visit Hebron,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/13/israel1,"Unfazed by the bloody consequences of his morning stroll around a shared holy site in Jerusalem, the Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon has now called on Jewish schoolchildren to make pilgrimages of their own: to Hebron, one of the crucibles of the Palestinian uprising. Mr Sharon's suggestion that every Israeli pupil should visit the West Bank city, where a strong force of troops guards an enclave of 400 Jewish settlers in the midst of 120,000 Palestinians, could prove explosive. It was delivered in several interviews to the Israeli press appearing yesterday and today. Hebron, revered by Muslims and Jews as the burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has had some of the fiercest clashes of the last seven months, and the greatest misery. In the old city, dominated by the Tomb of the Patriarchs, 40,000 Palestinians have been under almost constant curfew for months. Two weeks ago a Jewish baby girl was killed by a Palestinian sniper. The city is the Holy Land's second most important religious site - second only to the compound Mr Sharon visited in Jerusalem's old city last September. That tour, to the area revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, set off the uprising which has claimed 460 lives, mainly Palestinian. In an interview to be published today in the Yedioth Ahronoth, Mr Sharon suggests that every Jewish school pupil should be required to visit the Jewish enclave in Hebron: the most extremist settlers in the West Bank. ""These are our roots. The settlers in Hebron have taken upon themselves a role for which we must all thank them,"" he told Israel's biggest circulation newspaper. Mr Sharon was more expansive in the liberal Ha'aretz. ""A normal people would see to it that every child was brought there, that Hebron became an obligatory chapter in the education of every young person. And that every foreign diplomat or official visitor was taken there."" The prime minister went on to rule out the evacuation of the Jewish settlement in Hebron, or of those in the Gaza Strip. A day after Israeli tanks drove deep into a Gaza refugee camp - the most significant incursion into Palestinian territory since the intifada began - Mr Sharon's refusal to contemplate the removal of any of the settlements, which are the focus of the uprising, signals a further toughening of his position. Yesterday his advisers said he was at his farm in southern Israel contemplating his next move. But the assault on the Khan Yunis camp appears to have deepened the cycle of violence: Mr Sharon said he would order Israeli troops to enter Palestinian territory again if soldiers and settlements came under fire. In the morning Israeli soldiers shot dead a Palestinian farmer and wounded another man at a junction in the Gaza Strip. The army also reported a sharp rise in grenade attacks on its base near Rafah, on the border with Egypt. In the West Bank an Israeli soldier was shot and seriously wounded near the village of Beit Jala, which lies between Jerusalem and Hebron. During the Passover holiday, which ends tomorrow night, the spot in Hebron where 10-month-old Shalhavet Pass was shot has become a pilgrimage site for Jewish settlers.

world/2001/apr/23/israel2,'Which side will get tired first?',World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/23/israel2,"In the wake of Sunday's suicide bombing in Israel and the continuing bloodshed in the occupied territories, the press commentators are in doom-mongering mode. In a thoughtful analysis for the Tel Aviv daily, Ha'aretz, Danny Rubinstein notes defence minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer's comment that, ""The question is: Which side will get tired first? It won't be us."" But, Rubinstein comments, it may not be the Palestinians either: ""In fact, insofar as public stamina is reflected by events on the ground in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Palestinians are not showing any signs of fatigue or collapse. The opposite is true. Despite all the obstacles, sacrifices and woes, it appears that the Palestinian population in the territories can forbear and continue the intifada uprising for some time."" The Jerusalem Post reveals the extent to which prime minister Ariel Sharon has taken control of military operations, to the exasperation of his cabinet colleagues. The hawkish prime minister has, however, now been brought to heel: ""Security cabinet members will, from now on, be phoned before any military action or significant diplomatic decision, prime minister Ariel Sharon told his security cabinet yesterday, bowing to criticism following last week's large-scale raid into Gaza that security cabinet members say was ordered without their knowledge."" The Jordan Times has an arresting picture of tiny middle-class children in Beirut wearing headbands adorned with slogans of the Hamas militant group. The paper's leader writer laments the Israeli government's hardline policies: ""In most of his public comments, Sharon has hardly made mention of principles of international legitimacy, has totally ignored all peace efforts of the past few years and months and has repeated that Israel would not budge in its position on the future of Jerusalem and Jewish settlements. All moderate Arab states who had been lobbying the region to give Sharon some time to prove himself as a leader of Israel other than just the leader of a hardline Likud Party have now come to the conclusion that old habits and beliefs die hard."" The Palestine National Authority's ministry of information has an editorial blasting the Israeli government not only for the damage it is inflicting in the occupied territories, but for the damage it is doing to Israel itself: ""Over the years, Israel defended itself in the West by describing itself as having common values with the West... reiterating time after time that Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East.With the advent of the global village and information technologies allowing the people the world over to know almost instantaneously what is happening anywhere in the world, Israel is no longer capable of hiding its real self, being a theocracy not a democracy, and as one of the most cruel abuser of human values and human rights, particularly those of its Palestinian Israeli citizens in Israel proper and the Palestinian population in the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank, including Arab East Jerusalem and Gaza."" Veteran Palestinian commentator Daoud Kuttab, writing for the Arab Media Internet Network website, takes apart the belief, almost universally believed in Israel, that the conflict was started on the orders of Yasser Arafat: ""The intifada was not initiated by Arafat but by a restless Palestinian public that was tired of negotiating about the right to live in freedom and liberty of occupation. True, the Palestinian leadership didn't physically stop the intifada but there is no evidence that it started it... Every time Israel uses excessive force against Palestinians, it kills, maims and destroys property. Every time it closes areas and prohibits movement, they are simply increasing the Palestinian anger and hate against the occupation and the settlers who get apartheid-like preferential treatment. These Israeli actions, not Arafat's lack of action, are the main reason for the continuation of the Palestinian resistance.""

world/2001/apr/18/israel,Fears over Israeli army shootings,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/18/israel,"Seventeen-year-old Bassam Zaharan was suspected of wounding an Israeli soldier with a knife. If convicted, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years. But the Palestinian teenager will not be appearing in court or going to prison: Israeli forces shot him dead before he could be put on trial. According to the army, an Israeli soldier ""was lightly to moderately wounded from a Palestinian stab"" at a West Bank checkpoint near Tulkarm early yesterday. The army said the attacker - described as a ""terrorist"" - escaped but was pursued by Israeli forces. ""Forces began searches during which the stabber was found. The force opened fire toward the assailant and killed him,"" a brief statement said. Yesterday, human rights organisations on both sides of the Middle East divide questioned whether Israeli troops had followed their own regulations in dealing with the incident. However, an Israeli army spokesman said that after the teenager was tracked down, he had threatened the soldiers with a knife and they had shot him in self-defence. The body of Zaharan, who had been visiting the West Bank from Jordan, was handed over to Palestinian police. Bassim Eid of the Palestine Human Rights Monitoring Group said: ""Any Palestinian right now who tries to approach an Israeli checkpoint is regarded with suspicion. Some soldiers just open fire. The Israeli version has not been confirmed yet by any Palestinian sources. ""According to their regulations, if he tried to escape they should shoot in the air and then shoot at his legs. It's better to arrest than to kill."" The penalty for a knife attack would depend on the severity of the injury, but the most serious charge - attempting to kill - would normally result in a seven to 10-year sentence, he added. The Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem also said it would be investigating the incident, but that ""there are so many cases daily that we can't get to every incident the day it happens"". The organisation said that the rules of self-defence authorise soldiers to shoot to kill during an attack, but not if the assailant is running away. In London, Amnesty International urged the Israeli army to take the soldiers in question off duty in order to investigate thoroughly. ""Only if there is an immediate threat to life are security forces permitted to use lethal force,"" a spokesman added. According to Amnesty, the Israeli army has investigated very few killings by its soldiers. It did examine the killing of a Palestinian woman, Fatima Jamal Abu Jish, as she returned home from the hospital in Nablus where she worked as a receptionist last January. After originally saying that the soldiers had been responding to shots fired at their checkpoint, the army later admitted that no shots had been fired. At the Karni crossing in Gaza yesterday, an Israeli sniper reportedly shot dead another Palestinian, 15-year-old Hamza Obeid, with a bullet through his heart. It was not immediately clear what prompted the killing. A medical worker stationed at what has become a flashpoint for Israeli-Palestinian violence told Reuters: ""He fell dead among his friends. At the time there were no clashes."" In the Rafah area in southern Gaza, witnesses said a boy, aged 10, had been critically wounded in the head by two live rounds fired from an Israeli tank patrolling the border with Egypt. They said the boy had been shot on the street where he lived as he left home for a private lesson. The Israeli army said it was checking both reports. The killings brought the number of dead to at least 379 Palestinians, 71 Israelis and 13 Israeli Arabs since the Palestinian uprising began last September.

uk/2001/may/24/highereducation.internationaleducationnews,Palestinian lecturer held after trip to UK,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/may/24/highereducation.internationaleducationnews,"A Palestinian hospital administrator who took part in a health seminar in Oxford as a guest of the British Council has been held by Israeli intelligence services since returning to the West Bank almost three weeks ago. Samer Awartani, 30, presented a paper earlier this month to an international conference organised by the Department for International Development. He was arrested as he made his way home on May 7, at the Allenby bridge border crossing between Jordan and the West Bank. Israel's supreme court, the high court of justice, has turned down two petitions to grant him access to legal counsel, according to lawyer Andre Rosenthal, who has taken up the case on behalf of Physicians for Human Rights. Last night the international development secretary, Clare Short, said she was deeply worried about Mr Awartani, and launched an investigation into what had happened to him. ""We are now making inquiries to find out where he is and to ensure he is safe,"" a DfID spokeswoman said. Mr Awartani's family accused Israeli participants at the seminar of filming his presentation - on the difficulties faced by his hospital in the West Bank town of Nablus during the Palestinian uprising - without permission. One of the Israelis is believed to have been a retired senior officer from the army's medical corps. Israeli military and government officials had no immediate comment on Mr Awartani's arrest last night. ""I do not know anything about it,"" said Ra'anan Gissin, the spokesman for Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon. Mr Sharon has authority over Israel's General Security Service, the domestic intelligence agency which detained Mr Awartani. Mr Awartani has had no visitors since his arrest and the secrecy shrouding his detention has heightened concerns for his welfare. It is not clear where he is being held, although Mr Rosenthal said he had been through at least two detention1 centres, in the central town of Petah Tikva and in Haifa. ""Our position is clear: we are concerned because we do not know what has happened to him. We do not have an explanation as to why he is being detained,"" said David Martin, who heads the British Council in East Jerusalem. ""It seems unlikely that he has been involved in any illegitimate activity, and that is what is disturbing."" Mr Rosenthal said the high court's refusal to intervene in cases involving the GSS was depressingly common, and that detainees are often held for extended periods without access to lawyers. However, the court ruled yesterday that Mr Awartani may be allowed to see a lawyer next week. ""I was told today that unless there is something very, very outstanding that I would be allowed to see him,"" Mr Rosenthal said. Despite the information blackout, Mr Rosenthal said he had been assured that Mr Awartani was not considered a ""ticking bomb"", a classification which would enable his interrogators to apply strongarm tactics to thwart any potential attack. Mr Awartani's family describes him as a dedicated professional who worked long hours at his job as administrative director of the Rafidia hospital. Rafidia is the largest hospital in the West Bank and Mr Awartani was in charge of 450 employees. He has no history of political activism, and has never been jailed or questioned by the Israeli authorities. His trip to Britain for a week-long seminar in Oxford, calledPatient Empowerment and Healthcare Management, was fully paid for by the British Council and DfID. ""He spoke as a participant in the course and from what we have been told he said nothing exceptional,"" Mr Martin said. ""We would not like to be a precedent in the future for people being sent overseas by the British Council. If there was some cause to detain him, why was he allowed to leave the country? Why was he detained on his return? These are the concerns going through our minds."" 3A close relative of Mr Awartani, who asked not to be identified, said he became nervous that Mr Awartani might be arrested when an Israeli participant in the seminar filmed his presentation - the only one to be recorded. ""One Israeli told him: 'This is a gift for you when you return back home.'."" He said Mr Awartani's presentation had been restrained but he had focused on how the hospital had coped with the wounded during the Palestinian uprising, the types of bullet injuries, and the difficulties of operating under Israel's siege of the West Bank.

world/2001/apr/16/israel.guardianleaders,Leader: Hope is disappearing in Middle East,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/16/israel.guardianleaders,"The lurching descent of Ariel Sharon's government into increasingly harsh military action against the Palestinians is a mark of its bankruptcy. Sharon is a leader pledged to bring peace and security, but with no idea of how to achieve either, whether by diplomatic or military means. His initial formula for a return to negotiations was so unrealistic that only the most deluded sympathiser could imagine there was any chance that Yasser Arafat, beleaguered though he is, could accept it. His more recent position is that, following a complete end to Palestinian violence, there might be a possibility of a Palestinian state on a maximum of 42% of the West Bank and Gaza. This is not just unrealistic but surrealistic. Possibly Sharon does not really mean it, since one presumes that Shimon Peres, his foreign minister, has been trying to open up talks with the Palestinians on a somewhat different basis. But, with a public position of this kind, the distance the Israeli prime minister might move in actual talks is reduced to a few percentiles, not remotely enough to bring Palestinians back into a peaceful dialogue. Arafat has sent envoys to security talks, and there has been one high-level meeting in Athens, followed by lower-level encounters in Israel, with another meeting due this week. Arafat may indeed have to consider a ceasefire, but if he does so, it would only be out of desperation, to gain himself and the Palestinians a needed breathing space. If there were to be such a deal, a renewal of violence is as predictable as the sunrise. Sharon himself has ceased to mention peace except in a perfunctory manner, and has begun to warn Israelis that they will need ""a lot of stamina"" to endure a long and ""grim"" struggle. Yet his military options seem as unpromising as his diplomatic ones. He has escalated Israeli responses to Palestinian attacks, sending in helicopter gunships to hit barracks housing Palestinian security forces, and staging abductions in Palestinian areas and political assassinations in Gaza. Last week, the Israeli Defence Force, at Khan Younis, for the first time invaded territory that had supposedly passed under the full control of the Palestinian Authority. There was another smaller incursion at Rafah this weekend. But a full reoccupation of Palestinian areas would be a step that Sharon would find hard to take, with its obvious costs in terms of casualties, in international condemnation, and in its impact on relations with Arab neighbours. The renewal of hostilities across the Lebanese border remains a dangerous possibility as yesterday's attack and counter-attack shows. What applies to reoccupation applies equally to the policy of withdrawal from parts of the West Bank that some have suggested: it would be ideologically impossible for Sharon because it would involve abandoning a number of settlements. Meanwhile, the fighting is daily eroding the will to peace on both sides. Even those Palestinians who have their doubts about the wisdom of this second intifada blame the Israelis for creating circumstances in which it was unavoidable, while a majority of Israelis, a recent poll suggests, no longer believe peace with the Palestinians can be achieved. What is left? One possibility is a continuation of the conflict, but with more incursions into Palestinian territory, more shelling, more assassinations, and more severe economic measures. The other is that such pressures will lead to a cease-fire, but one not followed by substantive negotiations and which will ultimately fail. These grim alternatives will satisfy neither the Israeli nor Palestinian peoples.

world/2001/jan/23/books.booksnews,Céline manuscript rediscovered,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/23/books.booksnews,"The original manuscript of one of the most influential and disturbing masterpieces of 20th-century literature has resurfaced after being missing for more than 50 years. French researchers had spent 20 years trying to track down the 876-page manuscript of Journey to the End of the Night, written in black ink and crayon by Louis-Ferdinand Céline. Their hunt ended this month when a Parisian bookseller said he had been contacted by an anonymous British collector asking him to sell the manuscript for him. The bookseller, Pierre Bers, refused to identify the collector or explain why the manuscript had wound up in his hands. The manuscript was last seen on May 29 1943 when the sick and impoverished writer sold it to a Parisian art dealer for Fr10,000 (£970), along with a small painting by Renoir. The manuscript could fetch up to £500,000 under auction at Piasa in Paris in April. ""Its reappearance, after 50 years of mystery, is a literary bomb, as explosive as the book's original publication in 1932,"" said literary critic Valerie Duponchelle of Le Figaro newspaper. A writer and doctor, Céline (1894-1961) was one of the most controversial Frenchmen of his day - a war hero, anti-semite and Nazi sympathiser, dubbed during his lifetime as ""a writer created by God to scandalise"". Journey to the End of the Night (1932) was his first novel, and an immediate success. A coruscating critique of modern society, war and mass production, the book was written in earthy, contemporary French vernacular. Its modern anti-hero had much in common with Céline. Indeed, the book covered the author's life from 1913 to 1932 - from the trenches in the first world war (Céline was seriously wounded at Ypres), to running a trading post in Africa and working on a Ford assembly line in Detroit. Typical of the book's bleakness is this passage: ""In this world we spend our time killing or adoring, or both together. 'I hate you! I adore you!' We keep going, we fuel and refuel, we pass on our life to a biped of the next century."" His second novel, Death on the Installment Plan (1935), was also a success. During the war, he was denounced on the BBC as a traitor and fled to Berlin. In 1951, he was permitted to return but his new works were badly received. Bearing similarities to Samuel Beckett or Thomas Bernhard, Céline's works have influenced writers such as Henry Miller, Kurt Vonnegut and William Burroughs.",2001-01-23T03:16:37Z,"{'polarity': 0.011570065736732419, 'subjectivity': 0.3796456629789963}",0.3796456629789963
world/2001/jan/11/brianwhitaker,Bin Laden stars at Afghan wedding of the year,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/11/brianwhitaker,"Afghanistan's social event of the year was no match for the wedding of Madonna and Guy or Posh and Becks. But the atmosphere was as jolly as it ever gets in Kandahar. Osama bin Laden - one of America's 10 most wanted men, with a $5m price on his head - beamed and shook hands with guests at the wedding of his son, Mohammed. In what was claimed to be exclusive footage, the Arab satellite channel, al-Jazeera, yesterday showed father, son and male guests squatting on a carpet in a tent. ""It was such a simple wedding ... however, it revealed much,"" al-Jazeera said. There was, for a start, no hint of risqué jokes about the groom's bachelor life in the speeches. Ayman el-Zawahiri, the most distinguished guest, made the first speech - about the Palestinian uprising. As leader of the Egyptian jihad, he is believed to have organised the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in Cairo in 1981. He is also an absentee defendant, along with Bin Laden, in a trial which opened in New York on January 3. Both men are accused of involvement in the 1998 bomb attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania which killed 224 people. They face possible death sentences if convicted. The bride is a daughter of Abu Hafas al-Masri, an Egyptian who fought alongside Bin Laden against Soviet forces in Afghanistan during the 1980s, and now serves as his military aide and deputy. She has not been named, but in a country where women are banned from working and from education beyond the age of eight, that is not surprising. Both bride and groom were born in Pakistan while their fathers were fighting across the border in Afghanistan. The ceremony, which took place on Tuesday, was attended by Afghan officials and Arabs living in the country, the television station said. Last month the UN imposed fresh sanctions on Afghanistan's Taliban regime, demanding that they hand over Bin Laden for trial. The Taliban say it is against tradition to hand over a guest to his enemies. Some observers yesterday saw the photo opportunity presented by the marriage as a further gesture of defiance against the US at a time when jurors are being sworn in for ""We are not aware of the marriage,"" a spokesman said.",2001-01-11T02:37:40Z,"{'polarity': 0.06733511586452762, 'subjectivity': 0.34872676343264575}",0.34872676343264575
world/2001/jun/07/worlddispatch.johnaglionby,On the Philippine frontier,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/07/worlddispatch.johnaglionby,"Machine gun-toting bodyguards, a bomb-proof car and a seven-figure sum in travellers cheques are not at the top of most people's packing list when planning a tropical beach holiday. But if your destination is the clear blue seas and white palm-fringed beaches of the Philippines, then you might be forgiven for taking such precautions. Britain's Foreign Office articulates the danger more succinctly than most, in large capital letters at the top of its latest travel advisory to the south-east Asian archipelago. ""In recent weeks there has been an increase in kidnappings in Manila and throughout the Philippines, including in popular resorts,"" the warning reads. ""There is also a threat from random bombings. At this time, we strongly advise against any travel to Mindanao and Palawan. British nationals should remain vigilant throughout the Philippines and exercise great caution when considering travel to any coastal resorts."" The reason for this stark alert is simple. Kidnapping for ransom has always been something of a national sport in this south-east Asian archipelago, and in the last month there have been two major incidents that sparked a mass exodus of tourists and prompted many others to cancel forthcoming trips. On May 22 several people were grabbed from a beach on the island of Mindanao but were released within a couple of days. A week later 20 hostages were seized from a resort on the island of Palawan - supposed to be the last safe paradise in the country - and whisked 250 miles in a speedboat to the southern island of Basilan. Nine of these captives, which include three Americans, and at least five others seized during the kidnappers' attempt to evade the massive pursuit operation are still being held. Nine hostages have managed to escape, although the manner of their flight to freedom has ""release after ransom received"" written all over it. Earlier this week a group of American servicemen and their local guides were captured while trekking on the slopes of Mount Pinatubo, less than 50 miles north of Manila. They were lucky in that their kidnappers were satisfied with taking their weapons and nothing else. All these come on the heels of two audacious raids on Malaysian resorts last year in which more than 40 people, including 19 foreigners, were seized. The kidnappers ended that caper more than $10m in the black. The news on the bombings front is slightly more reassuring. There have been no explosions in Manila for a month, although the last two blasts, which were left in public places and designed to kill indiscriminately, left 22 people dead and many more injured. So when is it all going to end? Not anytime soon, is the short answer. There is a massive gun culture in the Philippines - which is unsurprising, considering that the United States was the country's last coloniser and remains the source of much inspiration - and it shows no sign of being reined in. Stories abound of people being shot dead in karaoke bars following arguments over whose turn it is to sing. Whereas in most countries the sign at supermarket entrances asks people to deposit bags with an attendant, in most Filipino stores the notice reads: ""Please leave your guns at the counter."" In last month's mid-term election campaign, ""only"" 80 odd people were killed as candidates' private armies battled it out to gain the upper hand. Amazingly, many social commentators considered this to be a drop in the ocean compared to what had been expected. And then there is the attitude of some local authorities. When Wahab Akbar, the governor of Basilan island, heard last year that some of his relatives had been abducted, he did not start counting out a ransom but instead ordered his heavy squad to seize the kidnapper's wife and children. The tactic paid off. Taking away the guns would certainly reduce the problem but it would not eliminate it, as the most notorious kidnapping gangs are driven by ideology. The south's most infamous group is Abu Sayyaf, responsible for the Palawan attack and last year's raids. Based on Basilan and the neighbouring island of Jolo, Abu Sayyaf claim to be fighting for an independent Muslim state in the southern Philippines. This they were, along with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) until 1999 when the police killed the movement's founder, Ustaz Abdurrazak Janjalani. Since then, their driving force appears to have become kidnapping for ransom in order to get rich quick. The MILF and MNLF, based on Mindanao island to the north of Basilan, appear to have been converted to the benefits of negotiation. But if President Gloria Arroyo fails to develop the region and offer the groups a decent autonomy package, kidnappings could once again become the gentler side of the insurgencies. Communist rebels affiliated to the New People's Army are claiming responsibility for capturing the American servicemen. Their demands are slightly more hazy than their Islamic counterparts, but the government, wisely, is not dismissing them out of hand. So unless you believe that lightning never strikes twice in the same place, it might well be better to delay that trip of a lifetime to Palawan for a few years.

world/2001/may/01/gender.uk1,Jeanette Winterson on body image,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/01/gender.uk1,"Why are women so obsessed with their breasts? It's a problem, and it's a big one - 36C at least. Women want larger breasts and they will pay to get them. The weekend's news was dominated by MoD disclosures that female soldiers are so worried about what stuffs their full metal jackets that they will go through medical and psychiatric panels to qualify for the operation that makes them ""a happier soldier"". Second in line are policewomen. I blame guns and truncheons. If your phallic symbol fires 40 rounds unaided, or hangs a foot long by your thigh, you won't be worrying about the size of your dick. It's obvious that women in active service should have weapons that mimic and magnify what they hide under their uniform. We need: a) more hand grenades - what could be a better copy of what we keep in our knickers? b) A new, round, scary girl-toy, a cross between a ball and chain and a cartoon bomb, that will whack a thug senseless when it's not clipped around your waist in stainless steel provocation. Go girl! This is the real message. Before you think I'm getting too San Francisco, let me ask you how many women look for well-hung in the same way that men stare obsessively below the neck? I'm all for a Wonderbra - wouldn't hand-wash anything else - but why can't men enjoy the game instead of fixing on your boobs like a terrier at a pair of molehills? Behind all this up-front anxiety is the age-old problem: women want to look the way men think they should look. And in the armed forces, if you're not a Playboy pin-up, you must be a lesbian. You think I'm kidding? Here's a confession not quite out of Nude Readers' Wives. My trainer at the gym is ex-army. Her experience over nine years, rising through the ranks, is that women who want to squaddie are so suspect as ""real women"" that they have to come the Marilyn Monroe just to get even. It doesn't help that forces units are fed on pornography. My trainer tells me fellow soldiers kept torn-out porn pics in their pockets. Her personal appearance was continually under fire. Plenty of women she knew were receiving treatment of various kinds. If women in the forces are on medication, in therapy and wanting operations, is it their problem or the price they are made to pay? So I'm over 40, wear a Wonderbra and go to the gym three times a week. Isn't that as appearance-conscious as wanting implants? Well, no. I do it because I want to be the best I can be with my limited resources. I enjoy feeling healthy and strong. It would be great to look like Julia Roberts but it's not going to happen. Why worry about it, and why worry some boob-brained man won't find me pneumatic enough? OK, OK. One of the reasons I go out with girls is that men are such a pain in the - well, you choose where. I like men but I find heterosexual culture oppressive. If only women would stop trying to please men, for no better reason than that they are men, we might all be happy with the body we inherit and learn to put our energies into the life we make. The saddest thing about this latest bout of boob-mania is the fact that women's bodies are still seen as deficient, in need of correction. Over and over, the medics consulted argued that if women didn't like their bodies, it was appropriate for science to amend them. This is woman as incomplete, unfinished goods. The real reasons for women's dissatisfaction with themselves are ignored. It seems it is better to risk the rise in cancers and brain tumours linked with breast surgery, reported last week, than to change the dismal truth that men control women's images of themselves. I'm not interested in censorship, women-only communities or the dowdier by-products of feminism, but I believe a woman's body should be a pleasure, not a penalty. We don't need men to tell us how we should look and then offer to fix it for us on the operating table - all to make us feel better, of course. The one good thing to come of National Boob Week is the news that M&amp;S is introducing electronic bra sensors to ensure a perfect fit, whatever your shape. Burn that tired pink Playtex. Buy yourself a Julia Roberts and celebrate the woman you are. • This column appears fortnightly.

world/2001/feb/18/andrewmeldrum.theobserver,Zimbabwe throws out journalists,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/18/andrewmeldrum.theobserver,"As part of an intensified wave of repression, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe's government yesterday expelled two foreign journalists, giving them 24 hours to leave the country. The action is the latest in a series of assaults on journalists, judges and opposition politicians. The government yesterday revoked the work permits of Joseph Winter, correspondent for the BBC African Service, and Mercedes Sayagues, correspondent for the South African paper the Weekly Mail and Guardian. No reason was given except that they were journalists. Ms Sayagues was on business in South Africa and returned to Harare yesterday. Immigration officials initially refused to let her enter Zimbabwe but she pleaded to be allowed to be reunited with her nine-year-old daughter and so was given 24 hours to wind up her affairs and quit the country. 'As a journalist I have been reporting on human rights abuses and the general breakdown of the rule of law in Zimbabwe. The action taken against me is small compared to those Zimbabweans who have been murdered, tortured and beaten,' said a defiant Ms Sayagues. The two journalists are taking urgent legal action against their expulsion, but are expected to leave Zimbabwe later today. Supporters of the Mugabe government have already beaten and threatened Zimbabwean journalists and earlier this month the printing press of the independent Daily News was destroyed in a massive bomb blast. In the past week the government has threatened Supreme Court judges, arrested opposition politicians on spurious charges and sent army troops into Harare's townships to beat residents at random. Three hundred of Mr Mugabe's war veterans invaded the Supreme Court and forced the five judges to flee. The judges have received death threats. Supreme Court Chief Justice Anthony Gubbay succumbed to the pressure and resigned. But the other Supreme Court judges are making a stand against the government. Justice Nick McNally refused to accept early retirement. Justices Wilson Sandura and Simbarashe Muchechetere refused to meet with Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa. Zimbabwe's Supreme Court has been admirably independent and in December issued carefully considered reversals to Mr Mugabe's 'fast track' land seizures, ordering police to remove thousands of Mr Mugabe's supporters from lands they were illegally occupying. In January the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional Mr Mugabe's amendment to the Electoral Act which stated that no legal challenge could be made to the results of parliamentary elections. The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) is pressing court cases against the results of 40 parliamentary seats with strong evidence of state-sponsored violence, intimidation and fraud. To make it more difficult for the MDC, its president, Morgan Tsvangirai, was on Thursday charged with inciting violence against the president, along with four MDC members of parliament. In September last year Mr Tsvangirai said, 'We call on Mugabe to resign peacefully or he will risk being overthrown violently.' They all deny the charges. Mr Mugabe's new crackdown on independent voices, using state violence and intimidation, is widely seen as preparation for the presidential elections. There is speculation that he is trying to strengthen his position to call them this year instead of on the due date of April 2002.",2001-02-18T03:46:46Z,"{'polarity': -0.032187257187257186, 'subjectivity': 0.3526806526806527}",0.3526806526806527
world/2001/jun/20/worlddispatch.kateconnolly,Once upon a time in Bulgaria,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/20/worlddispatch.kateconnolly,"""You Britons only associate Bulgaria with two things,'' sighed a travel journalist I met a couple of years ago in his native Sofia as he sipped at his rakiya. ''Uncle Bulgaria and roses."" Our meeting took place just days after a stray Nato bomb destined for Serbia had landed on a house in the suburbs of Sofia - in Rose Street, no less - piercing through an attic roof and heading out of the living room while a baby slept upstairs. It was in some ways, a time to celebrate, joked some of my Bulgarian friends. At least it got the Balkan country on the front page of the world's newspapers. The historically strife-ridden country found itself thrust in the limelight once again earlier this week after a general election which has no known precedent anywhere in the world. The man who was born to be king - and spent only a few years on the throne as a boy before communists turfed his family out - returned to power, but this time via the ballot box, rather than by divine right. Simeon Borisov Saxe-Coburgotski II says he has set Bulgaria on a new course of reforms which will transform the country forever. On Sunday he announced he favoured a broad coalition government with those who shared his priorities: speedy economic growth, and the push to join the European Union and Nato. He has yet to declare which parties he wishes to bring into his coalition or what his position will be. But political analysts and those not among the 43% who voted for him (his nearest rivals, UDF, got 18%) are now asking just what the man who would be king can do for his country. The riveting election campaign was as much about celebrating the return of an exiled king as it was about putting Bulgaria, a stable Balkan country for the past four years, back on economic track. ''Their problem from now on will be the need to respond to expectations of a miracle and the impossibility of this happening,'' Krassen Stanchev, head of the Institute of Market Economics thinktank said on Bulgarian television. ''A debate on the future agenda of society has yet to begin,'' he added. The king's party, the National Movement for Simeon II, was voted in following more than a decade of slow-moving reforms and the latest legislative period during which many found their living standards slipping lower than ever before. The average Bulgarian spends 50% of his or her earnings just on food. But Simeon's critics accuse him of not having clearly defined his future role and for delivering vague promises. The 64-year old businessman, who was until recently based in Madrid, has said that within the next 800 days he will have made a significant difference to people's lives. In some quarters of Bulgaria the word was that countdown clocks were being manufactured to measure the days. In that time he wants to improve living standards, increase pensions and the average £60 a month salaries, boost the standing of ethnic groups, increase foreign trade, uproot corruption and reduce the 20% unemployment rate. Within the next year he aims to have created 10% growth, a goal which economists have thoroughly pooh-poohed. Some say he has been reading too many fairy tales. Others say the problem is that he is part of a fairy tale himself and thus cannot see clearly. ''The tsar's 800 days start today,'' wrote the popular tabloid 24 Hours. ''He will govern us, whether we believe him or not. But we will remind him of the lessons given to those who have tried to govern us before.'' The question is, just how much of his power is simply symbolic? Staunch republicans say that in Bulgaria's case it's dangerous if many people have voted for Simeon simply because they think that he has a right to be in power. Some have accused Simeon of trying to brainwash the electorate. In some ways it is hardly surprising that the impoverished electorate has fallen for the fairy tale, which goes, if we are sitting comfortably, as follows. Once upon a time - in 1937 - a baby boy was born to King Boris. Simeon was considered special - by his parents at least - from the start. To celebrate his son's arrival, Boris granted amnesty to 4,000 prisoners, upgraded the exam results of every schoolchild and sent an air force major to the River Jordan to collect the baptism waters. In 1943 Boris died - he was allegedly poisoned by Hitler - after which the boy king took to the throne. Just two years later, a communist-rigged referendum led to the abolition of the monarchy and he fled into exile. His country was battered by decades of communism. It became grey and bleak. And then, one day, the boy king returned. The sun came out; the gypsies in their shanty towns came out to cheer him on, his voter-subjects broke down police barriers to glimpse him, and a team of young lawyers and economists, a popular singer, an actress as well as (what else) a magician, were on his parliamentary list to bring him back to a position of power. Following his election victory, the king mulled over whether he should become prime minister, or remain an éminence grise, ruling from the sidelines. It is too soon to say ""and they all lived happily ever after"". As one newspaper quipped prior to the election: ''We hope it's not the case of the emperor who has no clothes.'' Or, as a Bulgarian phrase puts it, he's a bit of a ""cat in a bag"" - a reference to accepting a pet kitten before you've even taken a look at it.

world/2001/mar/15/balkans,International: Macedonia brink of civil war,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/15/balkans,"Macedonia appeared to be on the brink of civil war last night as fighting between police and ethnic Albanian rebels erupted close to Tetovo, the country's second largest city, and threatened to ignite another Balkan conflagration. At least seven policemen were injured in the violence, which marks the spread of the ethnic Albanian insurgency into north-western Macedonia. Meanwhile, Yugoslav security forces, with Nato's consent, rolled into the buffer zone between Kosovo and Serbia yesterday to push back rebels who had occupied the Presevo valley. The artillery and machine gun fire which could be heard coming from hills a mile from Tetovo seemed to be getting closer to the city. The latest clashes began on Wednesday and took place 35 miles from previous incursions. ""The situation is horrible. They're shooting at our positions with various types of weapons. There is a major attack under way,"" said Stevo Pemdarovski, a spokesman for the Macedonian interior ministry. Around 200 ethnic Albanian rebels were reported to be involved in the fighting, which is taking place in and around the village of Larce. Mr Pemdarovski blamed the attacks on the National Liberation Army, an ethnic Albanian rebel group that emerged in Macedonia two months ago. ""We are at the brink of an explosion. I don't know what they have in mind, there may be attacks on other towns in Macedonia. We are there with all our forces _ but they have hand weapons, mortars and heavy weapons. They've built these up over a long period of time. These are not new ones."" The spreading conflict casts doubt on Macedonian claims that the guerrilla groups did not have a solid base inside the country but were coming in from Kosovo. Last night fires began to burn in the wooded hills surrounding Tetovo and flares lit up the sky. Young men watched from the city's main square. ""We've been waiting for this moment for 40 years,"" said one man who refused to be named. ""We have nothing here, no work or any rights."" Opposition to the ethnic Macedonian government has been strong among Tetovo's majority Albanians for a long time. Albanians make up over a quarter of the Macedonian population, but their language has yet to be given official recognition in the constitution. Further north, on Kosovo's eastern border, convoys of Serb military trucks and armoured personnel carriers churned into the Presevo valley at dawn yesterday, disgorging paratroopers and paramilitary police into wooded hills controlled by ethnic Albanian guerrillas. Nato peacekeepers watched from helicopters and observation posts as the Serbs plodded through fog and mud to reclaim the southern tip of the three-mile buffer zone created in June 1999 to separate the two armies. Since January last year ethnic Albanian extremists have exploited the vacuum to arm and train a guerrilla force - the Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac, known by its Albanian initials UCPMB - to bomb and shoot the lightly armed Serb police officers who patrolled the area, which is inside Serbia. From Ostrovica ridge, just inside Kosovo, Yugoslav army units could be seen waving flags and making three-fingered victory signs as they fanned into the countryside. Under terms agreed with Nato they cannot use tanks, enter villages nor fire first if confronted by rebels. Their task will be to cut rebel supply lines without repeating the atrocities committed two years ago against ethnic Albanian civilians. To demonstrate good faith, Slobodan Milosevic's successors named the mission Operation Peace. Belgrade and the guerrillas signed a 20-day ceasefire on Monday but few expect it to last that long. Several detonations, thought to be mortars, rocked the area two hours after the Serbs arrived but it was not known who fired.",2001-03-15T11:29:45Z,"{'polarity': -0.015802556818181816, 'subjectivity': 0.34883996212121204}",0.34883996212121204
world/2001/apr/03/israel,Israeli helicopter gunships kill Islamic militant in Gaza,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/03/israel,"Israeli helicopter gunships hunted down and rocketed an Islamic Jihad commander in the Gaza Strip yesterday, the first such assassination since Ariel Sharon became prime minister. With yesterday's killing of Mohammed Abdel Al, 28, Mr Sharon appears to be trying to snuff out the six-month Palestinian intifada and calm Israeli anxieties about security. His security advisers say he favours assassinating Palestinian activists as part of a strategy of directly punishing the leaders of the uprising. After the bombing of the residence of Yasser Arafat in Gaza City, and four mobile homes used by Mr Arafat's Force 17 bodguards in the West Bank city of Ramallah, yesterday's assassination further stoked passions in what is unfolding as a particularly bloody phase in the uprising. As darkness fell, a fierce gun battle was under way along the main road in the West Bank town of Bethlehem, with Israeli tanks and machine guns pounding blocks of flats fronting the Aida refugee camp. An Israeli soldier was reportedly killed and several Palestinians injured - including a small girl who was hit in the eye by shrapnel - as a two-hour battle spilled over from the camp to the Paradise Hotel, another local landmark. Witnesses said the hotel's top flour was almost completely destroyed by tank fire from nearby heights occupied by Jewish settlements. The latest surge in violence is also driving up tension in Hebron, where hundreds of soldiers are deployed to protect an enclave of 400 extremist Jewish settlers. Overnight, the settlers rigged up a bomb from a gas cannister to blow up a Palestinian shop. Yesterday's assassination is likely to provoke new international condemnation of Israel for returning to a policy which has seen the execution of at least a dozen Palestinian activists since the intifada began. The lead-up to the killing began in Gaza yesterday morning when three attack helicopters started to circle the southern town of Rafah for several hours. Eventually, they located Abdel Al amid the squalor of the Brazil neighbourhood, whose open sewers and refugee hovels run right into the border with Egypt. At least three missiles pierced his white Peugeot, reducing it to cinders and instantly killing the Islamic Jihad militant. ""The first hit the rear of the car, and Abdel Al struggled to get out of the driver's seat. Another two missiles hit the vehicle, turning it into a ball of flame,"" said a witness, Salim Abu Yedin. The assassination was the first since February, when Israel deployed helicopter gunships to kill a colonel in Mr Arafat's Force 17 unit as he was driving through Gaza City. In November, the car of Jamal Abdel Razak, a Fatah fighter, was ripped by machine guns, killing three other people. The Israeli army accused Abdel Al of planting bombs along Israel's security road between Rafah and Egypt, and near Jewish settlements, and of arming suicide bombers who carried out a devastating attack inside Israel in 1995. Abdel Al was jailed without charge by Mr Arafat's Palestinian Authority in 1997, when security forces of both sides waged a joint campaign against Hamas and Islamic Jihad bombers. But to Israel's fury, he and several hundred other militants were freed last October and regrouped to perpetrate a spate of bombings against Israeli civilians, including one last week that injured three people. Efraim Sneh, Israel's deputy defence minister, defended the assassination. ""He is the type of person we must target if we are serious about combating the violence,"" Mr Sneh told Israel radio yesterday. ""People involved in terror are targets."" However, the Palestinians, still smarting from the seizure of five members of Force 17 by Israeli undercover units on Sunday, claimed the attack amounted to Israeli state-sponsored terrorism. Last Friday, one of Mr Arafat's legion of advisers warned the Palestinian leader in writing that he had learned from his contacts in Israeli intelligence of a plan to assassinate senior members of the administration. In Beirut, a statement from Islamic Jihad threatened revenge: ""We say to the enemy leaders that assassinations and liquidations will not scare us. We are a people stronger than death""",2001-04-03T02:01:47Z,"{'polarity': -0.01625360750360751, 'subjectivity': 0.34614538239538245}",0.34614538239538245

world/2001/feb/01/usgunviolence.usa,Student held over plans for Columbine-style attack,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/01/usgunviolence.usa,"A Californian student who was apparently planning a Columbine-style attack on a college campus has been arrested after a photo laboratory assistant developed pictures of the man posing with a huge arsenal of weapons. Police found a tape recording in which the teenager expressed his admiration for the Columbine school killers and apologised in advance to his family and friends. Al Joseph DeGuzman, 19, who attended De Anza college about 10 miles from San Jose in Silicon Valley, was arrested after a young woman at the local drugstore developed his prints showing him pictured with an arsenal that included 30 pipe bombs, 20 molotov cocktails, four rifles, a sawn-off shotgun and a cache of ammunition. The woman, who is the daughter of a police officer, called the police and managed to stall Mr DeGuzman when he arrived to collect his pictures until police arrived. Initially, Mr DeGuzman said the arsenal in the photograph was fake. But at the home that he shares with his parents, police found the arsenal and notes about the intended attack. They said some of the bombs were quite sophisticated in their design. A tape recording detailed Mr DeGuzman's plan of attack, which was due to take place this week. He said in the recording that he would wake at 3am and plant the bombs at 4.30am. He had a detailed diagram of the De Anza college campus, which is used by 28,000 students. He was apparently going to start his attack during the busy lunchtime period. The teenager is also reported to have expressed his admiration for the two schoolboys who killed 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves at Colorado's Columbine high school in 1999. A police spokesman said of Mr DeGuzman's tape recording: ""He felt they [the Columbine students] were heroes. He was going to go out the same way and was going to kill as many students and staff as he could in the process. He was leaving a record for history."" Mr DeGuzman apologises on the tape to his family and friends. There was little indication of any reason for the planned attack. Mr DeGuzman was not doing badly at his studies, did not appear to have emotional problems, was apparently acting alone and did not have a criminal record. His parents said that they respected his privacy and did not go into their son's room. His main motivation seemed to be to imitate the Columbine killings and he appeared to have been planning the attack for nearly two years. The student is being held at Santa Clara county jail and bail has been set at $100,000. He is likely to be charged with illegal possession of a shotgun and bomb-making equipment. The incident is the latest in a series involving students and schoolchildren who appear fascinated by the Columbine killings and try to take weapons on campus.",2001-02-01T02:28:05Z,"{'polarity': 0.03152298850574714, 'subjectivity': 0.463448275862069}",0.463448275862069
world/2001/apr/26/israel,Israelis tense on eve of independence day,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/26/israel,"Ori Wald is 15, his girlfriend Natalie Warshafksy 14, and they share a teenage certainty about what they will and will not do. They will not ride on buses, they will not tarry in public places and they will be safely tucked up at home when the rest of Israel celebrates independence day today. Many Israelis shared their unease yesterday as they mourned their war dead before giving themselves up at sunset to the outdoor concerts, barbecues and maddening traffic queues that distinguish the national holiday. None more so, perhaps, than the 80,000 people of Kfar Saba, a town of wide avenues and shopping malls north of Tel Aviv which has been bombed four times by Palestinian militants since the uprising began. The last suicide bomber, from Hamas, struck near the main square on Sunday, sidling up to a bus before killing himself and a middle-aged doctor and injuring dozens of others. By yesterday afternoon the soundmen were at work in the square, setting up the stage for the public party. People drifted by to watch; some told stories of their escapes: the missed bus, the sudden change of routine, the pipe bomb that was so close that the smoke curled in through the living room window. Several said they would miss the party for fear of another attack. ""I am afraid to go out,"" Ori Wald said. ""We are going to stay at home and watch TV this year because, if I was the one doing the killing and the bombings, I would do it right here."" After Sunday's bombing of route 29, he and Natalie feel too jittery to take the bus. Yesterday they walked through the fields into town, a 25-minute journey. ""It's kind of funny. It is our independence day but we don't feel independent in our own country because if we go out we could die,"" he said. In Kfar Saba, as elsewhere, the anxiety has been stoked by official warnings that Palestinian militants may try to wreck the festivities. To Palestinians today commemorates a calamity - the event that robbed them of their homes, making them refugees for the last 53 years. They mark Israel's creation on May 15 as Nakba Day, the day of the catastrophe. Yesterday, with Israelis caught up in their own fears, the army tightened its siege of Palestinian towns in the West Bank and the teeming territory of Gaza. At Jericho and other West Bank towns, long queues of seething Palestinian motorists formed at military checkpoints. Such hardships barely registered in Kfar Saba, even though the town lies only a few minutes drive from the West Bank city of Qalqilya. Even people who identify with the Israeli leftwing say it is too soon to think of resuming peace talks with the Palestinians. Some who say they are on the centre, such as Rina Ferdinaro, a bookkeeper lugging two bags of groceries across the square, say it would be better to focus on war. ""We have to give them a huge blow - we have not been strong enough so far - we have to be decisive. It's clear we can not live in peace. At least let us live in quiet."" But less than two months after Ariel Sharon was installed as prime minister, there are doubts whether he can deliver his promise to crush the uprising. The doubt increased when US pressure forced Mr Sharon to abandon his plan to reoccupy a square mile of Gaza last week. ""I think the Palestinians only understand the language of force,"" Ina Finker, a native of St Petersburg who has lived in Israel for 10 years, said. ""But we as a nation lack the independence to use force because of pressure from the United States. Our hands are tied."" Despite the anger, Kfar Saba is no bastion of the Israeli right. The town bucked the national trend that swept Mr Sharon to power and remained loyal by a tiny margin to the loser, Ehud Barak. Like most other Israelis, the Labour party mayor, Yitzhak Wald, feels betrayed by the past seven months. But he believes that eventually Israelis and the Palestinians will have to talk peace again. ""Look, I created strong and close ties with Qalqilya, because I believe that you have to push for peace from below,"" he said. ""I must say though that I am very frustrated with what has happened in the last few months. This is a knock - but not a knock-out - to our will for peace.""",2001-04-26T00:55:28Z,"{'polarity': 0.05517797017797016, 'subjectivity': 0.440242504409171}",0.440242504409171
world/2001/jun/11/worlddispatch.brianwhitaker,Israel drives hard bargain for peace,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/11/worlddispatch.brianwhitaker,"It is now nine days since Yasser Arafat, facing the threat of Israeli reprisals for the Tel Aviv disco bombing, was forced to declare a ceasefire. Palestinian officials readily admit that Arafat's decision was motivated more by fear of what the Israelis might do than anything else. ""Israel threatened horrible retaliation and the Palestinians got so terrified they accepted what they would not accept before,"" one Palestinian official said last week. So far, with exceptions such as the killing of three Palestinian women by an Israel tank last weekend, the ceasefire has held surprisingly well. But, as many people cautiously point out, it is not an agreed ceasefire. There are two unilaterally-declared ceasefires - one by the Israelis and one by the Palestinians - which leave a lot of room for misunderstanding. The best reason for hope is the sheer amount of foreign involvement, and especially the role played so far by Europe. More by chance than design, Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, was in the Middle East when the Tel Aviv bomb went off and he headed straight to Arafat's office in Ramallah. Exactly what went on in the office is unknown, but by the time the next visitor arrived - UN special envoy Terje Larsen - a ceasefire declaration was already being drafted. Since then, European leaders have been in touch with Arafat daily, offering encouragement and promises that if the ceasefire holds they will make sure the Mitchell report, which mapped out a route from conflict to peace talks, will be implemented in full. For the Palestinians, the importance of having Europe engaged in this process cannot be underestimated. They have long regarded the United States as a one-sided mediator and, in their view, Europe will add balance. Another crucial factor is that it helps Arafat to present the ceasefire to a sceptical Palestinian public as something other than surrender: the reward for restraint is that the Europeans will hold the Palestinians' hands on the way back to the negotiating table. On the other side, the Americans have been cajoling the Israelis. In the daily phone calls between Washington and Tel Aviv, US secretary of state Colin Powell and Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon address each other as ""general"". Snatches of their conversations which have been leaked to the Israeli press portray Sharon as gritting his teeth while Powell praises him for the qualities that Sharon most abhors - such as restraint. It is not yet clear whether this international activity is a co-ordinated European-American double act aimed at bringing the two sides together, or a case of transatlantic rivalry. But there is little doubt that European initiatives spurred the arrival of the US cavalry - in the form of George Tenet, director of the CIA. Mr Tenet's immediate task is to turn the two unilateral ceasefires into one agreed - and, hopefully, workable - ceasefire. As far as the ceasefire terms are concerned, the Israelis are driving a hard bargain. They are, of course, entitled to do so, but the question is whether this is really intended to solidify the ceasefire or to impose such stringent demands on the Palestinians that they will either reject the agreement or be unable to abide by it. The Israelis, for instance, are insisting that ""ceasefire"" means not just guns and mortars but Molotov cocktails and stones. One stone thrown by a Palestinian teenager would thus become a breach of the ceasefire. The Israelis also want a Palestinian undertaking that there will be no violence in the Israeli-occupied areas of the West Bank and Gaza, where the Palestinian Authority is not allowed any effective means of enforcement. The Palestinians are also required to refrain from ""incitement"" - which they are already doing to some extent. In this morning's Jerusalem edition of the Palestinian newspaper, al-Quds, the deaths of three Bedouin women at the hands of an Israeli tank were reported an inside page rather than with banner headlines on the front. No similar requirement is imposed on the Israelis by the ceasefire proposals. Last week Ariel Sharon openly described Arafat as ""a murderer, and a pathological liar"" in a TV interview, and Israeli settlers called for all-out war against the Palestinians. The most controversial (for the Palestinians) of the Israeli ceasefire demands is the incarceration of up to 300 Hamas and Jihad militants. There is, of course, no suggestion in the proposals that Mr Sharon should embark on a round-up of settler vigilantes, who are the nearest Israeli equivalent. Tenet's proposals merely say that the Israelis should try to restrain them from attacking Palestinians. Palestinian satisfaction at the greater involvement of Europe is matched by Israeli dissatisfaction. Having reluctantly agreed to let European ""witnesses"" help - in a very limited way - to monitor the ceasefire and iron out difficulties on the ground, Israel is now trying to restrict their activities, despite evidence that they have been doing a useful job. Israel is insisting that if a ceasefire is eventually agreed, implementation of the next steps of the Mitchell report will be supervised by the Americans, with Europe providing only ""symbolic support"". Although there are certainly large numbers of Israelis who genuinely hope that the ceasefire will succeed, there are also substantial numbers who would prefer it to fail - and Ariel Sharon may be one of them. Sharon's worst nightmare, perhaps, is that the international community will drag him, grumbling and groaning, to the negotiating table... and that he will arrive there with nothing to put on it.

world/2001/jan/09/iraq.guardianleaders,"Leader: At last, Britain shifts ground on Iraq",World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/09/iraq.guardianleaders,"Indications that Britain wants to end joint air patrols over southern Iraq should be seen first and foremost by Washington as a warning from London that current US policy towards Saddam Hussein's regime cannot any longer be sensibly sustained or wholly supported. Whitehall may also be sending a message that the tougher, ""re-energised"" line advocated by incoming Bushmen like Colin Powell, if translated into increased military and economic pressure on Iraq, could make a bad situation worse. The Iraq ""policy review"", revealed in yesterday's Guardian and confirmed by Foreign Office officials, is but one move on the special relationship chessboard where the imminent arrival of George W Bush has given rise to a flurry of hasty recalculation. A unilateral US withdrawal from the Balkans, for example, could make it harder, mandarins might hint, to deliver national missile defence facilities in Yorkshire or to rein in the rapid reactionaries of Jacques Chirac's supposedly Nato-busting Euro-army. Labour may justly feel that this new, unabashedly rightwing US administration needs checks as well as balances. In pawn to the US on so many fronts, Britain has few courses to pursue. But given America's isolation on the issue, Iraq is one of them. British support, finally, is no longer unconditional. That is a step forward. Now the onus is on Washington to explain why it remains a useful idea to be blowing up Shia civilians (accidentally, of course) to protect Shia civilian insurgents who long since ceased to surge. There are, in any case, plenty of other persuasive reasons why the RAF's Tornados should turn for home. Southern Watch serves no useful purpose. These flights of futility are symbolic of a failed war and a failed policy of sanctions and intimidation (as we have said many times). They merely obstruct the dialogue necessary for ending the Iraqi people's suffering and gaining re-entry for the UN's exiled weapons inspectors. As Saudi Arabia has reportedly made clear, Britain's solitary role as supporting actor to America's top-gun leading men in the skies over Iraq damages its standing in the Middle East, stokes anti-British hostility and stymies business. It undermines independent British and EU attempts to mediate the Arab-Israeli conflict and foster relations with key states like Iran and Syria. It actually helps Saddam who, careless of his people's lives, welcomes every foolish bomb.

world/2001/jan/03/philippines,Graft testimony hits Philippines leader,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/03/philippines,"A bank executive in the Philippines told the impeachment trial of President Joseph Estrada yesterday that while the trial was already underway her boss at the bank ordered her to cover up the fact that Mr Estrada was the holder of a multi-million dollar account listed under a false name. Clarissa Ocampo, the senior vice-president of Equitable PCI Bank, testified before the senate's impeachment court that George Go, a friend of Estrada's, told her in mid-December to prepare documents to replace original papers showing the account belonged to a certain ""Jose Velarde"". Mr Go was chairman of PCI at the time. She said the name Jose Velarde, linked to at least one other large transaction, was an alias used by President Estrada at her bank. The testimony was some of the most damaging to date. Ms Ocampo had told a hearing of the impeachment court last month that she saw Mr Estrada sign a $10m (£6.8m) loan to the company of a friend, using the Velarde name, from a hidden account. Taking the stand yesterday, Ms Ocampo said she was told on December 11 to prepare documents to show that the account's owner was Jaime Dichavez, a businessman and close friend of Mr Estrada. The main trial started on December 7 with prosecutors alleging that Mr Estrada hid illicit fortunes under the fictitious name Jose Velarde. Mr Go resigned as bank chairman in mid-December, saying he wanted to distance his bank from any suspicion of involvement in corruption. Ms Ocampo also shocked those at yesterday's Senate trial by testifying that the signing of the new documents by Mr Dichavez on December 13 took place in the office of a prominent lawyer in President Estrada's defence team at the trial, Estelito Mendoza. The lawyer acknowledged yesterday that Ms Ocampo and the others were at his office on that day but said he was not involved in the signing of bank documents. Ms Ocampo said she decided to testify because she feared an attempt on her life to keep her quiet. She said she now lives in hiding. She became more frightened, she said, after five bomb attacks last Saturday killed 15 people and injured more than 100 in Manila. President Estrada is on trial on charges of bribery, graft, betrayal of public trust and violation of the constitution. It is the country's first impeachment trial. A conviction on any charge by two-thirds of the 22-member Senate would force him from office. The president publicly declared assets of $700,000 (£475,000) in 1999. He has a monthly salary of $1,000 as president. AP",2001-01-03T01:04:50Z,"{'polarity': 0.06975881261595547, 'subjectivity': 0.40378787878787875}",0.40378787878787875
world/2001/mar/09/spain.internationalcrime,Heist nets Eta 1.6 tonnes of explosives,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/09/spain.internationalcrime,"A spectacular theft of explosives by presumed members of the Basque group Eta at a warehouse near the French town of Grenoble yesterday raised fears of new bombings across Spain. French police said there were eight suspected Eta gunmen involved. Seven escaped, but police said they had under arrest one who had earlier held five people, including a small child, captive at the home of a warehouse guard while the gang loaded 1.6 tonnes of explosives on lorries. The unidentified suspect was captured at a police checkpoint in Annonay, 50 miles away, early yesterday morning, according to anti- terrorist police, who said he was driving a stolen car and carrying a loaded 9mm pistol and false identity papers. Despite the many checkpoints set up on routes south to the Basque country, there was no sign yesterday of the two lorry loads of explosives, 20,000 detonators and fuses. The early morning raid began when the gunmen burst into a security guard's house at Verey, on the outskirts of Grenoble. His family and friends were forced to the ground and held at gunpoint by two gang members while the guard was taken to the explosives warehouse and forced to open the gates. Two hours later, after the explosives had been driven away, the hostages were freed. Nicole Destenave, one of the captives, said the raiders were polite and well behaved. ""They kept their masks on all the time. They spoke Spanish and were very polite. They were considerate as well, because they asked us several times if we wanted a drink or needed to go to the bathroom,"" she said. In a single operation, Eta is believed to have dramatically increased its capacity to carry out attacks. The separatist group snatched eight tonnes of explosives in a combined raid with a French Breton separatist group in Plevine, western France, in 1999. But much of that haul was discovered by French police before it could be used. Spain's interior ministry said those explosives had now decayed and become unusable. That might explain why Eta bombs in Seville, Malaga and Madrid have failed to explode in recent months, although the group did successfully explode a car bomb in San Sebastian last month, killing two people. France historically has been a place of refuge, training and preparation for Eta. Its leaders have always lived and plotted their campaigns in the towns and villages of the Basque region of south-west France - away from the reach of Spain's anti-terrorist police. The group currently has one armed unit based in France, which travels across the border to carry out attacks, according to police. A few weeks ago French police in the southern region of Les Landes discovered a training ground where Eta members had been learning to use grenade launchers, and Eta's principal military leader, Juan Carlos Garcia Gaztelu, was captured in the south-western French town of Anglet two weeks ago. Eta claims it is fighting for a country of ""seven provinces"". Three of these - Labourd, Soule and Basse Navarre - are in France. It does not, however, carry out killings on French soil. ETA also recruits in the French Basque country. One of it most lethal units, which killed 31 adults and five children in the 80s and 90s, was made up entirely of French Basques. Eta has killed 800 people in 30 years, 26 of whom have died since it called off a 14-month truce in December 1999. Shortly after breaking the truce the group tried, but failed, to carry out a massive bombing campaign in Madrid. Spanish police uncovered two 900kg bombs in separate vans as they headed for the capital. Eta now has sufficient explosives to try a similar attack again and police believe they might be used during the campaign for May elections to the regional Basque government.

world/2001/mar/29/israel,Suicide bomber targets Israeli schoolchildren,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/29/israel,"A group of Israeli schoolchildren were drawn into a tragedy at a roadside stop called Peace Rendezvous yesterday when a suicide bomber sidled into their midst and blew himself up, killing two of the children and injuring four. After six months of the Palestinian uprising many people are numb in the face of almost daily casualties - but yesterday's attack stands out because the victims were children. So were the victims on the other side of the confrontation yesterday. In Rafah, on the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt, a Palestinian child of nine was killed and three others - all under 12 - were injured when they played too close to an unexploded Israeli shell lying in one of the few bits of open ground in the squalid town of open sewers and refugee shanties. People in Rafah said such injuries were becoming common, with soldiers from the adjoining Israeli army base regularly shelling houses that back on to the concrete blocks marking the border. For the seven Israeli schoolboys yesterday there was no indication of danger when they assembled in a car park in central Israel just before 8am. The Peace Rendezvous is a grand name for a petrol station and transport cafe flanked by palm trees, lying between the central Israeli city of Kfar Sava and the West Bank town of Qalqilya. The boys waited there every day for their school bus - an armoured vehicle in this case - because they leave their homes inside Israel to study at a religious seminary in Kedumim, a hardline Jewish settlement. Moments before the explosion at least one of the pupils noticed a man in his late 20s, with black hair and a moustache, drawing near, his black leather jacket zipped up to the neck despite the heat wave. ""Suddenly an Arab came up to my friends. He looked suspicious. Then I heard an explosion,"" Rafael Zomer, 15, told Israel Radio. ""I saw my friends blown apart."" The bomb, strapped to the extremist's body under his jacket, spewed nails and metal into the group, killing Naftali Landskoren, 14, and Eliran Rosenberg, 16. Doctors operated for several hours on one of the four wounded. Another boy was pierced in the eye. The one boy unscathed was standing away from the others. ""My friends were gathering at a corner of the gas station when the explosion happened. When I opened my eyes, I saw the ground was strewn with bodies and injured people,"" he said. Within hours the armed wing of the Islamist militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for the bombing and said there were more horrors to come. ""The elite unit 103 returned to base safely after moving the martyr [bomber] to the place of the operation,"" said a caller to Reuters news agency. ""There are still seven martyrs ready to strike."" This bombing - the third in 24 hours - brought a deepening sense of dread among Israelis that they and their children can never be safe while the Palestinian uprising goes on. There was an inevitability about Israel's first response: to surround Qalqilya with soldiers and tanks and mount a helicopter search for a suspicious van seen speeding from the car park around the time of the explosion. Meanwhile, the Palestinians had new sources of grievance against Israel's continued occupation of parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In the Jenin area, at the northern reaches of the West Bank, an elderly Palestinian woman suffocated after inhaling tear gas from a cannister thrown into her home. In Hebron extremist Jewish settlers from the 400-member enclave that festers in the heart of the Palestinian city of 120,000 went on the rampage for a second day, burning shops, homes and vehicles.

world/2001/may/02/warcrimes,Croat town now a criminal haven,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/02/warcrimes,"A senior British army officer has called on the international community to bring Croat war criminals to justice in Bosnia. Lieutenant-Colonel Hector Gullan of the Parachute Regiment and the SAS led an undercover investigation into the violent intimidation of refugees trying to return to Stolac, in south-eastern Bosnia, in 1998 and 1999. His report, delivered to the international authorities in Bosnia, called for the immediate arrest of 22 people suspected of violence, extortion and intimidation since the war, and for crimes against humanity during the expulsion of Bosnian Muslims from the area during the war in the republic in 1993. But the men his report accused are still free, and in many cases, still hold power. He made his statement yesterday, after receiving an OBE from the Queen for his services in Bosnia. ""Until those that perpetrated these appalling crimes, and who continue to rule the Stolac municipality by fear, are brought to account in the courts - either in Sarajevo or at the Hague [war crimes tribunal] - and made to stand responsible for what they did, this medal will never shine as it should,"" he said. Before the war Stolac was a town of 8,000 Muslims, 6,000 Croats, and 4,000 Serbs. Dark red poppies stand out against the bare mountainsides and the scrub vegetation growing in valleys where the stones seem to outnumber patches of soil. The town itself, 40 minutes' drive south of Mostar, was a jewel in this wilderness - proposed for inclusion in Unesco's list of world heritage sites. Mosques, Catholic and Orthodox churches stood close by. But during the war, and even afterwards, every sacred and secular building belonging to Muslims was blown up, including three medieval mosques and 2,000 homes. The aim was to prevent non-Croats ever returning. The town is still in ruins, and the ostensible nationalism has become a cover for hanging on to what was looted in the war, and present-day earnings from running guns to Kosovo, cigarettes to Italy, and stolen cars through the Balkans. Non-stolen goods can also be profitable. As no one dares to come from the capital here to collect taxes, even the sale of everyday consumer goods can line the pocket. Stark concrete crosses dot the valleys - with little pretence to religious significance. They are intended to mark territory, and keep out Muslims. Men with dark glasses watch for intruders outside bars and petrol stations. Within minutes, the whole network of war criminals and their protectors can be tipped off. Beside the road are stocks of building material in strategic places. If Bosnian police make another attempt to seize local criminals - they have failed twice so far - roads can be blocked in moments, and the police ambushed. While a few war-crimes suspects are in hiding, many of those accused of being torturers at the Dretelj, Heliodrome and Gabela concentration camps are still at large. Returnees - 2,000 Muslims and several hundred Serbs so far - sometimes see in the street those who abused and expelled them, and now treat them as second-class citizens. Farida (not her real name) will return soon from Mostar, despite her fear of doing so. She and her family were among those driven out in 1993. She carried her mother on her back for several miles in the terrible heat of July, with Croat snipers shooting over the heads of those fleeing, to spur them on. On this death march from Buna to Blagaj, Farida had to choose between saving her mother, or her two young children. To her torment, she abandoned her invalid mother to die in no-man's land. Fuad (his name has also been changed) describes Dretelj concentration camp that same month. Crammed into a metal-roofed hangar in one of the hottest areas of Europe, some prisoners died in the oven, others went mad. The guards sprayed bullets through the door, for fun. ""The victims are exaggerating,"" says the current mayor of Stolac, Zdravko Guzman. ""It's time to forget about the past, and turn instead to the future.' A member of the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) which wants to break from Bosnia, he laughs when I ask if it would help reconciliation if Croats apologised for destroying the Muslims' homes and mosques: ""Why should we apologise? Perhaps someone should apologise to us."" ""The people we would like to see arrested"" said Harry Leefe, head of the UN refugee agency in Mostar, ""are the serious criminals, the ones who organised the concentration camps, the torture, the rape camps; the ones who forced women and children to walk through minefields"". • A bomb yesterday in Vitez - a central Bosnian town dominated by the hardline HDZ - destroyed the office of the Social Democratic Party, which leads Bosnia's multi-ethnic government.",2001-05-02T02:24:12Z,"{'polarity': -0.05302478134110787, 'subjectivity': 0.3400388726919339}",0.3400388726919339
world/2001/feb/18/zimbabwe.andrewmeldrum,Zimbabwe throws out journalists,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/18/zimbabwe.andrewmeldrum,"As part of an intensified wave of repression, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe's government yesterday expelled two foreign journalists, giving them 24 hours to leave the country. The action is the latest in a series of assaults on journalists, judges and opposition politicians. The government yesterday revoked the work permits of Joseph Winter, correspondent for the BBC African Service, and Mercedes Sayagues, correspondent for the South African paper, the Weekly Mail and Guardian. No reason was given except that they were journalists. Immigration officials said other foreign journalists would also be kicked out of the country, but they did not give details. Late yesterday, Zimbabwe's Information Minister Jonathan Moyo claimed that Winter's work permit was invalid because, he alleged, he had bribed an official to forge a letter on his behalf. Winter denies the allegation and those who know him dismiss the charge as absurd. Sayagues was on business in South Africa and returned to Harare yesterday. Immigration officials initially refused to let her enter Zimbabwe but she pleaded to be allowed to be reunited with her nine-year-old daughter and so was given 24 hours to quit the country. 'As a journalist I have been reporting on human rights abuses and the general breakdown of the rule of law in Zimbabwe,' said a defiant Sayagues. 'The action taken against me is small compared to those Zimbabweans who have been murdered, tortured and beaten.' Supporters of the Mugabe government have already beaten and threatened Zimbabwean journalists and earlier this month the printing press of the independent Daily News was destroyed in a massive bomb blast. The explosion came just hours after Moyo said the Daily News was a threat to national security and must be stopped. In the past week the government has threatened Supreme Court judges, arrested opposition politicians on spurious charges and sent troops into Harare's townships to beat residents at random. Confronted by widespread unpopularity and a rapidly declining economy, Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party are attacking all critics. By threatening judges and encouraging them to resign, the Mugabe government has carried out what lawyers call 'a coup against the judiciary'. Three hundred of Mugabe's war veterans invaded the Supreme Court and forced the five judges to flee. The judges have received death threats and been excoriated in the state press by Mugabe and ministers. Supreme Court Chief Justice Anthony Gubbay succumbed to the pressure and resigned. But the other Supreme Court judges are making a stand against the government. Justice Nick McNally refused to accept early retirement. Justices Wilson Sandura and Simbarashe Muchechetere refused to meet with Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa. Zimbabwe's Supreme Court has been admirably independent and in December issued carefully considered reversals to Mugabe's 'fast track' land seizures, ordering police to remove thousands of Mugabe's supporters from lands they were occupying illegally. In January the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional Mugabe's amendment to the Electoral Act which stated that no legal challenge could be made to the results of parliamentary elections. The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) is pressing court cases against the results of 40 parliamentary seats with strong evidence of state-sponsored violence, intimidation and fraud. The MDC's president, Morgan Tsvangirai, was on Thursday charged with inciting violence against the president, along with four MDC members of parliament. In September Tsvangirai said, 'We call on Mugabe to resign peacefully or he will risk being overthrown violently.' They all deny the charges.

world/2001/mar/06/usgunviolence.usa1,Two killed by student gunman in US,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/06/usgunviolence.usa1,"A smiling high school student opened fire on fellow students at a school in the suburbs of San Diego, California, yesterday morning killing two and wounding at least 13 others. According to friends, the student had bragged at the weekend about his plans for ""another Columbine"" and asked if they wanted to join him. They had thought he was joking and had not reported his plans. The shooting awakened memories of the Columbine high school tragedy in Colorado in 1999 when two students opened fire on fellow students and teachers. President Bush yesterday extended his sympathies to the students and families and said: ""All of us must be mindful of the fact that some people act out their aggressions. ""Our hearts go out and our prayers go out to the parents and the teachers and the children whose lives have been completely turned upside down right now."" He described the shooting as a ""disgraceful act of cowardice"" and called on adults to teach their children that ""life is precious."" The shooting took place at the Santana high school in Santee, a suburb of San Diego, shortly after school had started for the day. It apparently started in one of the male bathrooms at the school when a ninth grade student, aged 15, described by fellow students as a ""known troublemaker"" pulled out a handgun and opened fire. Over the weekend, the student had complained to friends about being bullied and said he was ""going to start in the bathroom and work his way out."" His friends had not thought he was serious and said that, although he had on occasions complained about being bullied, he was someone with many friends. One friend of the alleged gunman said: ""He was talking about it at the weekend ... His dad had a bunch of guns."" He said that he and other fellow students did not take him seriously and did not report the conversation because ""I didn't want to get him into trouble."" One student even patted the student down before school in a semi-serious attempt to see if he was going to fulfill his threat. The gun had been hidden in the gunman's backpack. Fellow students said that the youth was smiling as he opened fire with a long-handled handgun in the bathroom, eventually hitting 15 people, including a security guard who worked at the school and a campus supervisor. Student John Schardt, 17, said: ""I looked at the kid. He was smiling and shooting his weapon."" Two of those hit, both students, have died of their wounds. One of those killed was 15 and died at the scene and the other in hospital. One of the wounded was said to be in a critical but not life-threatening condition. Panic ensued as students fled the area and the gunman re-entered the bathroom to reload, came out and opened fire again. Police Swat teams were on the scene within two minutes of an emergency call and the student, who was still in the bathroom, was taken into custody. A sheriff's department spokesman said only that ""a lone gunman"" was believed to be responsible although an investigation was under way to see if any friends had agreed to join him in the shooting.

world/2001/feb/10/usa.israel,Bush disowns Clinton peace proposals for Middle East,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/10/usa.israel,"Israeli tanks pounded Palestinian gunmen in the most ferocious clashes for weeks yesterday as the Bush administration disowned months of dogged effort by President Bill Clinton to deliver a peace deal in the Middle East. Yesterday afternoon's gun battle in the West Bank city of Ramallah was a clear message from the field commanders of the Palestinian uprising that the hardline policies of Israel's prime minister-elect, Ariel Sharon, will only reap more violence. In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, a teenage shepherd was killed by Israeli tank fire near the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom. He was the first Palestinian to be killed in the violence that has erupted since Mr Sharon's landslide victory on Tuesday. Yesterday morning Mr Sharon met the outgoing prime minister, Ehud Barak, to discuss forming a national unity government. Mr Sharon offered Mr Barak the post of defence minister. However, yesterday's violence overshadowed Mr Sharon's attempts at coalition building and the tentative diplomatic moves by the US and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to gauge the true intentions of Israel's most celebrated hardliner. The Palestinian leader telephoned Mr Sharon yesterday seeking to resume negotiations. ""The condition for that is a complete halt to violence,"" Mr Sharon responded. All signs point to an escalation in violence, with Mr Sharon confronting a car bomb in an ultra-orthodox Jewish neighbourhood of Jerusalem, sustained firing overnight on the Jewish settlement of Psagot, and gun battles in Ramallah - all within 72 hours of his election. The other plank of Mr Sharon's peace policy is his refusal to honour Mr Barak's promises on territory and Jerusalem that brought Israel ""closer than ever before"" to a peace deal with the Palestinians at the Red Sea resort of Taba last month. The talks were broadly based on proposals put forward by Mr Clinton in his last days of office. But the Bush administration has made it clear that it has scrapped any existing Clinton proposals and has stepped back from the active mediation practised by Mr Clinton . ""The ideas and parameters that were discussed in the last few months are - were - President Clinton's parameters and, therefore, when he left office, they were no longer a US proposal or presidential proposal,"" the state department spokesman, Richard Boucher, told reporters on Thursday. However, the US secretary of State, Colin Powell, is to visit Israel and the Palestinian-ruled areas later this month, and Mr Bush telephoned Mr Sharon and Mr Arafat to urge them to calm the region. Mr Powell's trip - to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Gaza and the West Bank, Jordan and Kuwait - will be his first foreign trip alone since he took office on January 20. Mr Bush told reporters: ""I certainly hope that people recognise a change does not necessarily mean that the peace process won't go forward. And I think we ought to take Mr Sharon for his word and that is, he wants to promote peace in the Middle East."" But in Ramallah yesterday demonstrators scattered for cover as Palestinian gunmen holed up in empty tower blocks shot over their heads at Israeli troops on an adjacent hill. Nearly 30 people were injured by live fire and rubber-coated steel bullets. A French photographer, Laurent Van Der Stockt, was shot in the leg. ""There is no chance to negotiate with Sharon, we must stop wasting our time thinking about that,"" said Marwan Barghouti, a Fatah leader in the West Bank.",2001-02-10T01:20:13Z,"{'polarity': 0.07965165043290044, 'subjectivity': 0.28386904761904763}",0.28386904761904763
world/2001/feb/07/4,'Hundreds of millions are destitute',World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/07/4,"February 7th [1951] To the Editor of the Manchester Guardian Newspapers Ltd Sir, We are committed now in Korea to a war for which, since the ""branding"" of China, no end can be foreseen. We are committed to a rearmament so vast that our sheer daily absorption in it must rob us more and more of the spiritual freshness and energy indispensable for the achievement of peace. Every day now our minds are being more completely conditioned: the ""hell bomb"" is the latest attraction in the Sunday press, and Amiel, whom not one Englishman in ten thousand has ever heard of, is brought on from the grave to warn us that long before ""The Hun"" invaded Belguim, ""the Russians"" were barbarians. It is impossible to exaggerate the deterioration even during the last two months. Useless, then, to repeat like a parrot, that war is not inevitable: war is now quite inevitable unless we make an almost superhuman effort, of a new and more positive kind, to prevent it. I suggest a two-point programme. First, the proposed conference with Russia, which has been hanging about as if we had eternity at our disposal and now looks like being held up (if it comes off at all) for heaven knows how many further exchanges, should be pressed on with as if our lives depended on its immediate convening ... Manoeuvring for position, warfare by ""Notes"", all should be thrown overboard: we just have not time for them ... The great thing is to get together on anybody's ground and then make a desperate effort to widen things out and achieve agreement. But now comes the crux: however certain our statesmen may be - and I share their certainty - that the Kremlin is primarily responsible for our present disasters, we must yet negotiate, as Mr Nehru has urged, not in the mood of war, but in the mood of peace. Nothing could be harder, but if we can make so vast an effort to rearm materially, cannot we make a comparable effort to disarm spiritually, to subdue our passions? And I suggest that apart from this particular conference with Russia, we should always and everywhere substitute human negotiations face to face for long-range paper warfare. Secondly, we should take the initiative in proposing for immediate discussion some variant of the plan already proposed by Walther Reuther [a US labour leader active in world affairs], namely that a great international fund should be established, as an urgent matter of life or death, for improving the conditions of those fellow human beings who, to the number of hundreds of millions, are starving, destitute and in despair. I should like to see our own country, by the size of its proposed contribution, challenging the world to a new kind of rivalry, a rivalry in the works of peace. So might international dis cussion, leading to international administration, find itself with a fruitful topic instead of a sterile one. So might the trend to war, issuing from a concentration on national as opposed to international interests, be reversed. So at last might swords be turned into ploughshares. May I ask through you, Sir, that all who are in agreement with this letter should send a postcard with just the word ""Yes"" and their name and address to me at 14 Henrietta Street, London WC2. I do not guarantee any action of any kind, but if the response is large enough something might possibly come of it. Yours, Victor Gollancz 14 Henrietta Street London WC2 www.waronwant.org",2001-02-07T02:44:02Z,"{'polarity': 0.13858939802336026, 'subjectivity': 0.4787021154945683}",0.4787021154945683
world/2001/feb/25/saudiarabia,Saudis deny Briton the right to fight for his life,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/25/saudiarabia,"Saudi Arabian authorities are flouting international law by not allowing British officials in Riyadh freely to see a jailed Briton who faces public execution, The Observer can reveal. Sandy Mitchell, 44, has been visited by British diplomats only twice since he admitted carrying out several car bomb attacks in a confession broadcast on Saudi television last month. Both meetings in Mitchell's Riyadh jail happened under strict supervision from Saudi security officers, and British officials were not allowed to ask him about his treatment prior to his confession, The Observer has learnt. Nor have consular officials been allowed to appoint a lawyer to his case. The revelations will raise fears Mitchell may have been tortured or otherwise pressured into admitting to carrying out the attacks. Stephen Jakobi, a lawyer acting on behalf of Mitchell's family, said: 'One has to wonder what is being concealed here. The way they are allowing access only with certain conditions makes one fear that something very nasty has happened to him.' Saudi authorities have told British officials that if they try to ask Mitchell questions about his guilt or past treatment, they will no longer be allowed to see him. Such conditions break international treaties regarding the treatment of foreign nationals jailed abroad. Mitchell was arrested on 17 December along with two other Westerners, Belgian Raf Schyvens and Canadian William Sampson. No consular access was allowed until after the three appeared on television on 5 February. The arrests have sparked a fierce - but discreet - diplomatic row: Britain, Canada and Belgium have all been stonewalled by Saudi authorities as they seek to gain more information on why the men confessed. If the men are convicted, they face being beheaded in a public square. Last week a senior Saudi prince stated that the three could be executed, but diplomatic sources close to the case believe the men will not face the death penalty. So far Saudi officials have linked all three with the lucrative and highly illegal alcohol trade in Saudi Arabia, but no clear motive has emerged as to why they would plant two car bombs, which killed Briton Christopher Rodway and injured four others. Nor has it been explained who planted two other bombs aimed at Western targets, one of which exploded several weeks after the three men were arrested. Saudi dissident sources have told The Observer that Islamic fundamentalist groups based in Saudi Arabia have been behind the attacks and that the Westerners are the victims of a cover-up. A veil of official secrecy has been thrown up around the issue and only a few Saudi security officers have been allowed detailed knowledge of the three men's case. 'Only a handful of officers know about their whole ordeal,' one Saudi source said. Other Westerners who have endured periods of detention in Saudi jails have described terrible conditions and abuses of power. Briton Phil Lomax, who spent several years in Riyadh as a security expert and knew Mitchell, told The Observer how he was once arrested on drinks charges in the middle of the night. Lomax said he was beaten several times by religious police who raided his compound. They kicked him repeatedly in the head and forced him to sign documents written only in Arabic, which Lomax cannot read. Although they found no alcohol at his house, Lomax was jailed for possession. He spent almost 70 days in prison and was set free only after signing a document terminating his job and losing all his possessions in the country. He was then taken to the airport and immediately deported. He said: 'It was a nightmare, an absolute nightmare. I had done nothing and yet I lost my job and had to leave the country. That is not justice.'",2001-02-25T03:21:09Z,"{'polarity': -0.045714285714285714, 'subjectivity': 0.3664285714285713}",0.3664285714285713
world/2001/feb/18/filmnews.film,Vietnamese beauty falls for Greene's real Quiet American,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/18/filmnews.film,"The centre of old Saigon stepped back nearly 50 years yesterday as filming started of an Australian adaptation of Graham Greene's eerie prophecy of the US debacle in Indochina, The Quiet American. Directed by Phillip Noyce, whose credits include Patriot Games and The Saint, the film is set in early 1950s Vietnam, a country wracked by war as the curtain comes down on French colonial rule. It tells the story of a doomed love triangle involving a jaded British war correspondent, Fowler, played by Sir Michael Caine, an idealistic American agent, Pyle, played by Brendan Fraser, and a young Vietnamese girl, Phuong, played by local newcomer Hai Yen. Fraser's character, Alden Pyle, is The Quiet American of the title, a man in the words of Greene's 1955 novel 'determined... to do good, not to any individual person but to a country, a continent, a world' - with disastrous results. The makers say they are aiming for a far more faithful adaptation of Greene's work than a 1950s Hollywood version, which turned the plot on its head to make Pyle an anti-communist hero. Scriptwriter Christopher Hampton, an Academy Award winner with Dangerous Liaisons, said he hoped Greene, with whom he worked on an adaptation of his later novel The Honorary Consul - which also starred Caine - would have been somewhat happier with this version of The Quiet American . But he said the author, who died in 1991, was a notoriously difficult man to please. 'I think he would be slightly happier,' Hampton said. 'But he was not disposed to be terribly happy with any of the adaptations of his books. When I did The Honorary Consul while he was still alive, I tried to be very faithful with that as well, but he wasn't too happy with it.' He said Greene had been 'outraged' by the original version of The Quiet American by Joseph L Mankiewicz, seeing it as a complete betrayal of the book's message. 'It was turned from an accurate representation of the historical circumstances of the time into an anti-communist tract, brought about, I suppose, by the climate of the time in America, where you couldn't take an objective view,' Hampton said. 'In fact, that's what the novel's all about - the incapability of people to take an objective view.' Hampton said he believed Greene's work still carried an important message today.'It's always timely to say ""Don't interfere in the affairs of other countries"".' The script has clearly struck the right note with the communist authorities in Vietnam, who gave approval on the grounds that 'it condemns the manoeuvres of hostile forces and foreign aggressors against the Vietnamese people'. They have allowed the film-makers to shut off a key section of a city centre thoroughfare renamed Dong Khoi - or 'Uprising' Street - after Saigon itself became Ho Chi Minh City with the Communist victory in the Vietnam War in 1975, to recreate the colonial-era rue Catinat. The production team say they have also secured permission to recreate a 1952 bomb attack Greene was to blame on a 'Third Force' - neither colonialist nor communist - that Pyle championed. The film-makers have succeeded in creating an authentically period feel on the set, with the ubiquitous Japanese motorcycles and cars of today giving way to vintage Peugeots, Citröens, bicycles and three-wheeled 'cyclo' pedal taxis of the colonial era. And more than 45 years after France's ignominious exit from Indochina, the kepis and khaki of its colonial police force and military again graced the streets of a city once dubbed 'Paris of the East'. The crew is scheduled to film for five weeks in Vietnam, with shooting also scheduled in Hanoi, the national capital, as well as the towns of Hoi An and Danang.",2001-02-18T12:01:55Z,"{'polarity': 0.04683317771553066, 'subjectivity': 0.3841425459072518}",0.3841425459072518
world/2001/feb/03/israel,Arabs braced for 'rabid' Sharon,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/03/israel,"Ariel Sharon's seemingly invincible lead in opinion polls is causing shivers of unease among Arab leaders contemplating the prospect of their greatest villain being crowned Israel's prime minister after next Tuesday's elections. Despite the efforts of his minders to repackage him as a peacemaker by restricting interviews and banning a debate with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, Mr Sharon raised hackles this week in Egypt and Jordan, the two countries which have peace agreements with the Jewish state. Mr Sharon's soft new image has also been undermined by pronouncements from extreme rightwing allies - potential cabinet ministers in the next government - that he would be prepared to bomb Tehran and Cairo. After engaging in a spat with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, Mr Sharon compounded his blunder by claiming that Jordanian officials had confessed to him their secret fears that their country would be swallowed up by a Palestinian state stretching from the edges of Tel Aviv to Iraq. The Palestinians, too, appear unnerved by the implications of a Sharon victory. Despite the deaths of more than 320 Palestinians during the four-month uprising, Mr Sharon has repeatedly criticised Mr Barak for not cracking down hard enough on protesters. Earlier this week, the Palestinian information minister, Yasser Abd Rabbo, called Mr Sharon a ""rabid and dangerous"" man with ""hostile intentions to reopen a wider conflict"". Leading Mr Barak by 17 to 21 percentage points in yesterday's opinion polls, Mr Sharon does not want to see a near certain victory snatched from his grasp by Israeli fears of a regional war. On Thursday, he told a Likud youth rally in Tel Aviv: ""I know Arabs and they know me. They take me at my word; they know my yes is yes, and my no is no, and they know I say exactly what I think. I can lead negotiations with the Arabs. I have started contacts."" Several men in the audience yelled out: ""Talk to who? They are all terrorists."" Such popular pressure, and the demands of coalition partners, could sway a Sharon government and lead to a further deterioration in relations with Cairo and Amman. Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a separate peace with Israel 20 years ago, recalled its ambassador from Tel Aviv last November in protest at an Israeli bombardment of the Gaza strip. Arab leaders began venting their loathing for Mr Sharon on Monday when Mr Mubarak told Israeli television he had no intention of meeting the Likud leader unless he was serious about getting a peace agreement with the Palestinians. ""I have a peace treaty with you [Israel]. Do I have to speak with Sharon? If he needs something and comes to me, he is welcome,"" he said. ""But if he needs nothing, leave him where he is, I don't need anything from him."" Mr Sharon shot back that he was not interested in speaking to Mr Mubarak either. A day later, Mr Sharon muddied the waters with Jordan, long suspicious of the man who famously said that Jordan was Palestine, provoking fears of a mass expulsion from the West Bank. Mr Sharon, who opposed the 1994 peace agreement with Jordan, told the largest circulation Hebrew newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, that a Palestinian state could threaten Jordan's monarchy. Jordan's prime minister, Ali Abu Ragheb, was furious. ""These statements are nonsense and are aimed at sowing discord between Jordanians and Palestinians,"" he said. • The Israeli army said yesterday that it was tightening restrictions on movement in the West Bank by further limiting access to Palestinian-ruled cities ""because of the escalation in the security situation"".",2001-02-03T01:59:31Z,"{'polarity': 0.0839422362149635, 'subjectivity': 0.4825210984301894}",0.4825210984301894
world/2001/feb/19/iraq.richardnortontaylor,Doubts over Iraq air strikes,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/19/iraq.richardnortontaylor,"The government's insistence that the US and British air strikes against Iraq are justified under international law is less firmly endorsed in Whitehall than ministers admit publicly, informed sources said last night. Private doubts about the legal basis of the no-fly zones over Iraq resurfaced as angry Labour MPs, MEPs and union leaders gave Tony Blair clear signals that they will be much more sceptical about intimate military cooperation with Washington now that a Republican administration is back in power - even though a general election is just weeks away. In public Mr Blair and his senior colleagues argue that the threat to the west from ""rogue states"" such as Iraq is real and leaves Britain and the US ""perfectly entitled to deter aggression"" as the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, put it. Allied arguments have cut little ice around the world as Arab leaders united in opposition to the air strikes and allowed the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, to portray himself as victim rather than aggressor. Under the Tories, successive legal advisers, including Lord Williams of Mostyn, the attorney-general, have reassured ministers that the no-fly zones are sanctioned by international law. However authoritative sources said last night: ""They are less confident in private."" Labour's rank and file is also more sceptical. Bill Morris, leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union, and Glenys Kinnock MEP expressed doubts about Friday night's bombings and the 10-year policy of sanctions which have failed to bring President Saddam to heel. George Galloway, the arabist Labour MP, flew to Baghdad and likened Friday's attack to ""Hitler marching into Czechoslovakia"" in 1939. ""What the British and American governments are doing is reckless, lawless and murderous. If they are not already working for Saddam Hussein then they might as well be because for every bomb that is dropped, Saddam is getting stronger,"" the Glasgow Kelvin MP said. More than 2,000 people - including Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Nabil Najim - protested against the bombings in Baghdad and at least 1,000 other protesters gathered near the offices of the ruling al-Ba'ath party. ""This dangerous aggression shows how much the Americans and Britons hate Iraqis and do not respect any international law,"" Mr Najim told the demonstrators. ""This aggression must be condemned."" Mr Blair and the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, led a platoon of ministers in defending the US-UK action as necessary to protect their air sorties from anti-aircraft attack by President Saddam's forces - and thereby to save the Kurds of northern Iraq and the southern Shi'ites from his murderous revenge. That is the legal basis which ministers invoke when challenged: the right under international law to intervene to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe such as the use of chemical weapons to kill 5,000 Kurdish villagers in the 1980s when the west still tilted towards President Saddam in his war with Iran. But, the no-fly zones are not specifically sanctioned by any UN security council resolution. Four days before Mr Blair flies into Washington to meet President George Bush, it emerged that Friday's air strikes were cleared by both leaders after requests from military commanders, the RAF as much as the USAF.

world/2001/may/06/news.mcveigh,'Dear Tracy' by Timothy McVeigh,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/06/news.mcveigh,"Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber due to be executed in 10 days, has given The Observer an exclusive insight into the 'triggers' for him to murder 168 people. In a remarkable letter, McVeigh said he wanted to explain his reasons for bombing the federal government building in 1995. Nineteen of his victims were children. McVeigh, due to die by lethal injection, wrote the letter to me two weeks after The Observer 's Life magazine published an account of his life that included photographs of him and his family. Calling me 'my distant relative', he joked: 'The pictures were far better than most people have used.' McVeigh urged me to contact his close friend, Bob Papovich, who was 'someone I have been discussing the ""why?"" with.' 'Ask him to sumnate [sic] the info I've sent him,' he said. 'Ask specifically for my three-page letter, 'Why I bombed the Murrah building"".' Right-winger Papovich, a close friend of McVeigh's and his co-conspirator in the bombing Terry Nichols, was surprised to get a call. 'I don't know what Tim's playing at,' Papovich said. 'One minute he's telling me the letters he writes are off-the-record, not for publications, then he gets you call me. I guess as his time gets closer he wants the story out.' Papovich runs his own campaign against the US federal government's 'tyranny and oppression'. He believes Nichols is innocent of involvement, and criticised McVeigh for resorting to 'violence to solve a problem'. Despite his initial qualms, Papovich obliged and yesterday faxed the letter to The Observer. In it, Gulf war veteran McVeigh, 33, makes it clear he has absolutely no regrets over the atrocity, disappointing those still hoping for last minute remorse. 'Borrowing a page from US foreign policy, I decided to send a message to a government that was becoming increasingly hostile by bombing a government building and the employees within that building who represent that government,' he wrote. He described how he waited 'patiently' for two years for justice for the 75 people who died during a botched federal raid on the Davidian cult headquarters at Waco, Texas, in 1993. But his forbearance ran out. 'I reached the decision to go on the offensive - to put a check on government abuse of power, where others had failed in stopping the federal juggernaut running amok. Foremost, the bombing was a retaliatory strike, a counter attack,' McVeigh wrote. 'It was at this time, after waiting for non-violent checks and balances to correct ongoing federal abuses and, seeing no such results, that the assault weapons ban passed and rumours surfaced of nationwide, Waco-style raids scheduled for spring 1995, to confiscate firearms.' McVeigh points out that the rumours turned out to be true. Government papers obtained by US media proved that raids on right-wing groups had been planned by agents of the FBI and the Bureau for Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 'For those who dimiss such concerns as ""paranoia"" you need to look at the facts as they existed and further reflect that the Waco raid was not imaginary - it was a real event,' McVeigh wrote. He described how a Jekyll and Hyde transformation came over him. He was no longer'little Timmy', and assumed a new personality: 'I again became the hard-core soldier who was trained to kill by my own government.' On Friday Papovich recieved a further letter from McVeigh, asking: 'How do you know I don't agree with the non-violent philosophy? Did it ever occur to you that I mindfully emulated the behaviour of our government, to make a statement in itself? 'By killing me they prove who they are. They make my point for me' At his home in Decker, Michigan, just a few miles from Nichols' farm where McVeigh first learnt to make bombs from fertiliser, Papovich insisted his friend was 'a compassionate and caring guy' who was preventing his family or friends from witnessing the execution to spare their anguish. 'He told me I'd be pissed at him when I found out who he had invited to the execution,' said Papovich. Yesterday the final surprise was revealed when US writer Gore Vidal said he had accepted McVeigh's macabre invitation. Vidal, who is on assignment for Vanity Fair, spoke sympathetically of McVeigh and told The Observer: 'McVeigh regarded the government as having committed a number of crimes. He was a highly decorated soldier in the Gulf war who became disillusioned about how it [the US government] treated Iraqis and and its own troops, through the use of chemicals. 'He is very intelligent and well-read, particularly on constitional law, and as I read it, acted out of a sense of justified grievance against the government. I would have preferred it if he had choosen an empty building. 'That's why I'm willing to overcome my abhorrence of capital punishmen to witness his execution.' This week McVeigh's former lawyer Stephen Jones will publish his own account of the bombing, claiming his ex-client was a pawn in a bigger conspiracy. But McVeigh, fell out with Jones during his trial, dismisses this and insists he alone detonated the 4,800lb bomb.",2001-05-06T00:21:25Z,"{'polarity': 0.16364841597796145, 'subjectivity': 0.5212775482093663}",0.5212775482093663
world/2001/mar/28/worlddispatch.ameliagentleman,'Spy' meeting shown on Russian TV,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/28/worlddispatch.ameliagentleman,"The Zoo Bar, hidden in the basement of one of the distinctive Stalin skyscrapers which dominate the Moscow horizon, was the venue for a meeting between two American military attachés and their Russian contact, shown on prime-time nationwide television. Little was audible above the buzz of pop music, except the occasional snatch of conversation; the men were apparently discussing the purchase of classified military maps. Another strip of grainy, black and white film also broadcast showed a Russian agent apparently telephoning his American handler, the US naval attaché, from a public pay phone in the capital and hurriedly arranging a rendezvous. This strange insight into the work of American intelligence officials was released yesterday as the Russian ministry of foreign affairs issued the names of the first four US diplomats ordered to leave Russia in the next few days. The broadcast appeared to be labouring the point that America is just as culpable in the raging spy row as Russia. While officials in Washington vent their rage about the work of Robert Hanssen - the FBI agent recently arrested on suspicion of spying for Moscow over the course of 15 years - and argue that a growth of Russian espionage activity triggered the crisis, this footage was apparently issued to inform the Russian population that US officials are themselves very busy recruiting new Russians informants. The fallout from last week's US decision to expel four Russians from Washington and ask another 46 to leave the country by the summer continues - rippling out into different spheres of diplomatic relations. The Russian ministry of foreign affairs has responded in kind demanding the removal of an equal number of embassy workers - according to the well-worn traditions of tit-for-tat diplomacy - but the neo-cold war chill has crept into other arenas. The foreign ministry accused George Bush's administration of ""immoral behaviour"" yesterday for its decision to hold talks in Washington with Ilyas Akhmadov, foreign minister of the separatist Chechen government, which is not recognised by Russia. In the wake of Saturday's bomb attacks in Stavropol, which killed 23 and injured more than 100 others and which have been blamed on Chechen terrorists, the ministry's statement was fierce. ""The latest bloody crimes by the Chechen terrorists in the Stavropol region allow one to describe this Washington 'show' as simply immoral,"" the statement read. There was also speculation that the bizarre case of an American research student, charged with possessing a small amount of marijuana might also have been swept up by the mood of diplomatic retaliation. When he was originally arrested in January, John Tobin, 24 - a trained interrogator and a US army intelligence unit completing a graduate studies programme in southern Russia - was suspected of espionage. Later Russian officials decided there was no basis for a spying case, but his drug charges were intensified on Monday, leaving him facing 15 years in prison if he is found guilty of involvement in a drug ring. Even a row over the rent of the US ambassador's Moscow residency appears to have been sparked by the spy scandal. Russia's deputy foreign minister Ivan Sergeyev, said last week that the rent on the building in central Moscow was far too low and that the US, if market rates were imposed and backdated, owed Russia around $6m (£4.2m). This morning, both American and Russian officials made diplomatic statements suggesting that they wished the row to come to an end. Foreign minister Igor Ivanov and US secretary of state Colin Powell spoke by telephone, with both sides suggesting a desire to restore constructive relations. US state department spokesman Richard Boucher said Russia's reciprocal expulsion of US diplomats was ""unwarranted"", but added the US aimed to cooperate with Russia. ""Obviously we have an important national interest in maintaining cooperative and protective relations with Russia. We do intend to work to advance those interests,"" he said. The foreign ministry in Moscow stated that Russian officials welcomed ""the announcement by a representative of the US state department of the American side's desire to put today's difficult moment in Russian-American relations behind us, and work toward their improvement and development"". ""We are ready for an immediate and constructive discussion of all burning international and bilateral issues with the US administration,"" a ministry statement said. It remains unclear whether these soothing words will prove enough to smooth over the fractures caused by the worst spy row since the end of the cold war.

world/2001/jun/04/comment.israelandthepalestinians,Comment: Israel's victims,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/04/comment.israelandthepalestinians,"If ever I am in Tel Aviv on a Friday I always make my way to that old lefty hang-out, the Cafe Tamar on Shenkin Street. From mid-morning onwards, as you sit outside in the strong sun drinking the terrible coffee, you can watch the city shutting down for the weekend and the street party beginning. By mid-afternoon the road is impassable. A heaving throng of Israeli teenagers roars up and down. Some are in uniform - soldiers or reservists on weekend passes who have come straight to Shenkin to meet up with friends before finding somewhere safe to stash their rifles. Late in the afternoon, another scene develops by the jetty on the northern side of the old Dolphinarium. A hippie crowd, hundreds strong, comes with drums for a jam session until the sun goes down over the Mediterranean. Then they disappear and the streets quieten for an hour or two. They go home to eat and get changed, then in the late evening they're out again, cruising along Ha Yarkon and the Tayelet in a cacophony of car horns. As the world now knows, the Dolphinarium also houses a club, the Pascha, popular with young Russian immigrants. Last Friday was ""ladies night"" - girls got in free - so there were more girls than usual among the crowd of teenagers queueing to get in and more girls than boys among the 18 Israelis killed (the youngest aged 14) and 120 injured in the work of a suicide bomber. The detonation could be heard across the city and doubtless it reached up into Islamic heaven where, smiling down at the carnage was Hussein Mohammed Tawil, responsible for another suicide bomb in Jerusalem in March. In a video statement he promised: ""I will tear their bodies and their bones into pieces so they will taste death. To kill the Zionists, the occupiers, we will do this in honour of the martyrs, in honour of the prophet."" On the morning of the nightclub bombing, David Landau, a columnist for the Israeli paper Haaretz, posed this conundrum: ""One would expect a country under terrorist attack to fortify its borders, seal every possible crack and vigilantly guard all official border crossings. But for this to happen, there have to be borders - the defensible kind that the army and the police can stand guard over."" Israel is the only country in the world where 200,000 of its citizens voluntarily choose to live among those they regard as their mortal enemies, at the same time demanding protection from their state. ""The settlements,"" Landau continues, ""are endangering the lives of the citizens of Israel: on account of the settlements, the army cannot provide adequate defence. They are endangering the country itself, because the army's powerlessness, caused by the lack of a defensible border, paves the way for terror that debilitates the society and threatens its future."" The settlers, indulged and coddled by every Israeli government, treating the Israeli Defence Forces like their own private militia, are a sect which has nothing whatsoever to do with the secular lifestyle of 70% of Israelis. The teenagers at the Pascha nightclub died for two reasons: because last September Yasser Arafat released Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists from jail and went into strategic alliances with them; and because Israel cannot, because of the settlers, seal its borders and prevent those terrorists from reaching into Israel proper. What is preventing peace in the Middle East is two sides refusing to control their extremists. Jews in the diaspora, many of whom have relatives in Israel, should stop excusing the occupation. If they don't care about the Palestinians, they should care about the lives of ordinary Israelis. They should be demanding that the settlers be cut loose. Sharon can choose to escalate this conflict into a regional war. Or he could evacuate every settler who does not choose to shoot it out unprotected by the IDF. He could then build an ""iron wall"" along the 1967 borders to keep the bombers out. Behind it, Palestinians would undergo immense suffering, particularly in Gaza, but they would be forced into making an historic choice. Should they unite behind the rejectionists, the Islamic fundamentalists who tell them that no suffering is too great, no child martyr too many to sacrifice for the final plan - the liberation of the whole of mandate Palestine and the Palestinian flag flying not just over Jerusalem but Tel Aviv, Netanya, Haifa and Eilat? Or should they listen to those other rejectionists, the largely western group of intellectuals for whom nothing less than a secular binational state will do. They have no strategy for this, no support inside Israel and no slogan other than ""Why can't we all just love each other?"" Israel, for them, can't exist because ""Zionism is racism"" - in other words Jews are the only people in the world to be denied self-determination. The third choice for the Palestinians would be to understand that the settlers are gone, the 1967 borders back in place, and that the rejectionists will ensure their suffering is eternal. The Palestinian Authority has not been merciful to collaborators and it doesn't shrink from holding public executions. Arafat will need to exercise the same zero tolerance against Hamas and Is lamic Jihad. If he does, he can return to the negotiating table for a final settlement and the Palestinians can establish their state. It is up to them to decide whether they endure another 50 years of unspeakable misery as they hold out for a perfect peace and perfect justice, or settle for what they have rejected three times, in 1937, 1947 and at Camp David last year, choosing armed struggle over partition and statehood. For its part, Israel boasts of being the only democracy in the Middle East. It is up to Israelis to ask if they want their fate to be held in the hands of a minority who despise the very existence of the teenagers of Shenkin Street - that is until they are in uniform, cannon fodder for the settlers' messianic dreams of biblical conquest. • Linda Grant's novel When I Lived in Modern Times, set in mandate Tel Aviv, won the 2000 Orange prize for fiction",2001-06-04T00:21:22Z,"{'polarity': 0.08221434277772308, 'subjectivity': 0.435795112555676}",0.435795112555676
world/2001/jan/23/iraq.ewenmacaskill,Pressure on Iraq over 'new weapons',World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/23/iraq.ewenmacaskill,"The Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, has rebuilt three factories which are now capable of producing chemical weapons, the US and Britain claimed yesterday. The disclosure is intended to step up pressure on Baghdad and signals a new hard line as George Bush begins his presidency. The US and Britain are trying to shore up efforts to contain President Saddam after the steady demolition of their trade embargo by Arab and European states. Similar intelligence reports formed the basis for the Desert Fox bombing raid by the US and Britain two years ago. Foreign Office diplomats have been in Washington in the last week discussing Iraq and other foreign policy issues with the new administration. An FO spokesman said: ""The general assessment that Iraq may be reconstituting biological and chemical weapons is one we share."" But the Foreign Office and US state department were careful to avoid saying they had proof, as this would automatically trigger new air raids. The claim comes just 10 days after the Pentagon made public an intelligence assessment of the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons worldwide. Its report said Iraq ""shows no let-up in its pursuit to reconstitute its pre-war weapons and missile capabilities"". According to the new reports, one rebuilt factory is using a mash made from castor beans that contains a deadly biological toxin called ricin. The Iraqis claim the castor oil is used for brake fluid. Another produces chlorine, which is used for nuclear production and for cleaning water. George Galloway, the Labour MP who has been leading the British campaign to have sanctions against Iraq lifted, said yesterday: ""There is a long campaign of misinformation about the purpose of factories as a prelude for US attacks."" He described the latest reports as propaganda ""to justify the increasingly unjustified siege of Iraq"". The US and the Foreign Office stressed that the reports were from officials in the old administration and should not necessarily be taken as an insight into Mr Bush's approach. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, is planning to meet Iraqi ministers next month to discuss lifting sanctions in return for allowing in UN weapons inspectors. Although the UN weapons team, Unscom, has not been allowed into Iraq since December 1998, the International Atomic Energy Agency, a nuclear proliferation watchdog, has been allowed to continue with less intrusive inspections. The IAEA is this week carrying out its annual inspection of nuclear material in Iraq. Four inspectors - from Egypt, Poland, Russia and South Africa - are visiting the Tuwaitha nuclear centre, 12 miles south of Baghdad, to check that low-grade material, sealed in 1998, has not been touched. The centre was the main site for Iraq's nuclear programme before the Gulf war and is the location of the Osiraq reactor, bombed by Israel in 1981. David Kidd, the IAEA's spokesman in Vienna, said the inspectors were carrying out tests to determine the quantity and quality of material stored. ""It's a thorough check, but no replacement for what the [UN] security council would like to have us do,"" he said. Several Iraqi defectors have claimed that President Saddam is continuing to develop a bomb. Salman Yassin Zweir, an engineer who was said to have spent 13 years working for the Iraqi atomic energy commission, said recently that work resumed in secret in August 1998. The American estimate is that it would take Baghdad at least five years to build nuclear weapons.",2001-01-23T03:16:45Z,"{'polarity': -0.01498771498771499, 'subjectivity': 0.3140049140049139}",0.3140049140049139
world/2001/jun/12/mcveigh.usa1,McVeigh: the final minutes,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/12/mcveigh.usa1,"Although President Bush used the occasion of Timothy McVeigh's execution to speak to the nation about capital punishment, the death of the Oklahoma bomber is unlikely to stem calls for the abolition of federal executions. These rare executions, carried out by the US government rather than by single states, have come under fiercest attack from opponents of the death penalty. The last federal execution was in 1963, when Victor Harry Feguer was hanged in Iowa. The circumstances 38 years ago could hardly have been more different from the extraordinary scenes and media coverage of McVeigh's last days. Feguer, 27, was a borderline psychotic and career criminal who abducted an Iowa doctor and took him across the state line into Illinois where he shot him in the head. It was the crossing of the state line that turned his crime into a federal offence. The motive was robbery, although Feguer gleaned only $25 and tried to blame an associate. Iowa's governor at the time, Harold Hughes, opposed the death penalty and attempted to have the sentence commuted by President Kennedy. But Kennedy said that considering all the facts he saw no reason for a stay of execution. ""I sure hope I'm the last one to go in Iowa,"" said Feguer. ""It would be too much to expect that I will be the last one anywhere."" He was right. At present, 38 states have the death penalty with some 3,500 people on death row. As a small-time criminal Feguer was typical of most federal execution cases, but there were more celebrated cases, the most famous being that of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, both of whom were executed for passing nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union in 1953 despite worldwide opposition and the mobilisation of the American left against the deaths across the US. Ethel Rosenberg was the first woman executed by the US government since Mary Surratt was hanged for her role in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. A wide variety of groups have joined forces to attack the federal death penalty, including Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Citizens for a Moratorium on Federal Executions. However, all the groups recognise that in the current president they have an unsympathetic ear: as governor of Texas, Mr Bush authorised the execution of more people than any other US governor -152. One of the main thrusts of opposition to federal execution is that studies show a racial and geographical imbalance between those sitting on federal death row. At his confirmation hearings, the current attorney general, John Ashcroft, said that he was troubled by evidence of racial disparities in the use of the federal death penalty, and that he supported a ""thorough study of the system"". Under the previous administration of Bill Clinton, both the president and his attorney general, Janet Reno, expressed concern when a federal study showed that 17 of the 21 inmates on federal death row were either African-American or Latino prisoners. The study found that Latinos were 2.3 times more likely than their white counterparts to face federal execution. President Clinton said last year: ""The examination of possible racial and regional bias should be completed before the United States goes forward with an execution in a case that may implicate the very questions raised by the justice department's continuing study. In this area there is no room for error."" According to Citizens for a Moratorium on Federal Executions, which includes former members of the justice department and civil rights and religious leaders: ""Whether someone convicted of a capital crime will receive a death sentence is highly dependent on the state or county in which that person was tried and convicted."" Some of the people in this lobby group support the death penalty but argue that they object to federal executions because they are administered unfairly - by which they mean that the circumstances vary so widely in different parts of the country. US attorneys - that is, prosecutors - in 16 states, including Texas, have been authorised to seek the death penalty in at least 50% of the cases submitted for consideration to the justice department. US attorneys in 21 other states have either never requested or never obtained authorisation to seek the death penalty. Of the inmates who are currently sitting on federal death row, almost one in three were prosecuted in a single state - Texas. One last ice cream, or a final mango Thirty-eight years and an act of symbolism separate Timothy McVeigh and the last US federal prisoner to be executed. At his final meal in Iowa in 1963, Victor Harry Feguer chose a single olive with pip, calling it the ""fruit of the tree of peace"". The 27-year-old killer said he hoped a new tree would sprout from his remains. McVeigh sent no such message. He chose two pints of chocolate-chip ice cream. Sebastian Bridges, killed recently by lethal injection in Carson City, Nevada, chose, among other things, lobster tail, lychee nuts, vanilla ice cream and a mango and wore a suit and tie to his execution. Murderer Jay Scott, 48, has had two final meals and lived to digest both. Twice he came within an hour of being executed in Ohio but was reprieved. His lawyers call his execution unconstitutional punishment for someone suffering mental illness. His new execution date is on Thursday.

news/2001/may/28/guardianobituaries.cuba,Obituary: Alberto Korda,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/may/28/guardianobituaries.cuba,"The Cuban photographer Alberto Korda, who has died of a heart attack aged 72 while visiting Paris for an exhibition of his work, will be best remembered for his portrait of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara - one of the most famous photographs of the 20th century, and one of the few that truly deserve to be called iconic. Born in Havana, the son of a railway worker, the young Alberto had a variety of jobs before he started working as a photographer's assistant. He was a runner for a betting shop and a door-to-door encyclopaedia salesman. He took up photography with frankly macho motives: ""My main aim was to meet women,"" he once confessed. ""I wanted to be near beautiful women."" He succeeded by marrying Cuba's most beautiful model of the day, Niurka, though his three marriages ended in divorce. Naturally charming and ebullient, the diminutive and wiry Alberto soon established himself as a successful fashion photographer, changing his surname from Díaz Gutiérrez to that of the British film-maker Alexander Korda because it sounded like ""Kodak"" to his Cuban ear. He soon had his own studio in Havana, and an expensive playboy lifestyle. Like so many of his compatriots, his life was transformed by the Cuban revolution of 1959. On an assignment in the countryside soon after the guerrillas defeated the dictator Batista, he encountered such poverty that he was converted to the revolutionary cause. He began to follow the new Cuban leaders around, offering his photos to the newspaper Revolución, whose offices were close to his studios. He spent 10 years as Fidel Castro's official photographer, using his skills to humanise the revolutionary leader's image in off-duty scenes - sharing moments with Ernest Hemingway and Jean-Paul Sartre, or confronting a caged tiger at the New York Zoo. It was while on an assignment for Revolución in 1960 that Korda took the famous photo of Che, at a protest rally after a Belgian freighter carrying arms to Cuba was blown up by counter-revolutionaries while being unloaded in Havana harbour, killing more than 100 dock workers. As he later recalled, it was a damp, cold day. Using a 90mm lens, he was panning his Leica across the figures on the dais when Che's face jumped into the viewfinder. The look in Che's eyes startled Korda so much that he instinctively lurched backwards, and immediately pressed the button: ""There appears to be a mystery in those eyes, but in reality it is just blind rage at the deaths of the day before, and the grief for their families."" Ironically, Korda's picture was relegated to an inside page of Revolución, giving pride of place to Fidel. The original remained on the wall of his studio until 1967, when he gave two 10"" x 8"" prints of it as a gift to the leftwing Italian publisher Giangiacomo Feltrinelli (the man who first published Dr Zhivago in the West, and who was blown up by a car-bomb in 1972). A few weeks later, Che was captured and killed in Bolivia - and became an instant martyr. When Castro addressed a memorial rally in Havana's Plaza de la Revolución, Korda's photo was used as a mural on the building facing the podium; it is still there. Feltrinelli instantly spotted the value of the image, using one print for the cover of Che's diaries, and giving the other to the makers of the posters which were soon being carried through the streets of Europe in the protest marches of 1968. This image of Che, noble and defiant, with tilted beret and flowing locks, rapidly spread to T-shirts and album covers, and was soon taken up by advertisers targeting youth, until it rivalled the Mona Lisa as perhaps the most replicated image ever. But Korda received no royalties; Feltrinelli had used the photo without permission, and even failed to credit him as the photographer. In any case, Korda had no remedy until Cuba rejoined the international copyright convention in 1997. Finally, angered when the image appeared in a Smirnoff advert in Britain - Che never drank - he asked the Cuba Solidarity Campaign to help him sue Smirnoff's advertising agency, Lowe Lintas, and the picture library, Rex Features, for infringement. By happy coincidence, he received the news of an out-of-court settlement on his birthday last year, during a visit to London for the Cuba, Si! exhibition of Cuban photography at the National Theatre. He immediately handed over an undisclosed sum to buy much-needed medicine for Cuban children. A lifelong smoker and rum drinker, Korda told marvellous anecdotes of the ascetic revolutionaries. ""Once, I had to take pictures of Che cutting cane with the workers,"" he said. ""He made me work for a week cutting cane before he'd let me take a shot. He was hard that way."" From 1968-78, Korda concentrated on underwater photography, until a Japanese exhibition in 1978 stimulated international interest in his work. From the early 1980s, he lived in modest semi-retirement, though he accompanied Castro on a recent visit to Venezuela and Mexico. In 1999, he appeared in the pre-title sequence of Wim Wenders's documentary, Buena Vista Social Club, rifling through photos from the heroic early days - here is Che, for example, playing golf with Castro (""Who won?"" ""Fidel, because Che let him"") - which ends with an image of a demonstration outside the US embassy that Korda called ""David and Goliath"". For some reason, Wenders fails to credit him. Speaking in Havana late last year, Korda, who leaves two sons and two daughters, said: ""Life may not have granted me a great fortune in money, but it has given me the even greater fortune of becoming a figure in the history of photography."" The Cuba Si! exhibition, which includes some of Korda's work, is at the Dick Institute, Kilmarnock, until June 16, and at Wingfield Arts, Eye, Suffolk, from July 7 until September 30. • Alberto Díaz Gutiérrez (Korda), photographer, born September 17 1928; died May 25 2001",2001-05-28T01:03:02Z,"{'polarity': 0.10512777023971054, 'subjectivity': 0.47526006331976484}",0.47526006331976484
world/2001/mar/30/israel,Arafat defies pressure to call off Palestinian uprising,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/30/israel,"Yasser Arafat faced new international pressure to call off the Palestinian uprising yesterday as he toured the site of Wednesday night's Israeli rocket attack on the headquarters of his personal team of security guards. The helicopter gunship attack on Force 17 in Ramallah has confirmed the unit's reputation as the most elite of the dozen or so security organisations in the West Bank and Gaza. Underlining the point, Mr Arafat left his helicopter yesterday and marched directly toward a Force 17 honour guard, clad in olive uniforms and black berets. As he saluted, a ban played the Palestinian anthem. Mr Arafat said that the intifada would continue ""until the Palestinian flag is raised on the walls, churches and mosques of holy Jerusalem"". In recent days the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, has regularly blamed Force 17 - and by extension Mr Arafat himself - for drive-by shootings at Jewish settlers, and indirectly for the bombing attacks in Israel which have been claimed by militant groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Earlier this month Israeli army officers said they had established a link between the commander of Force 17 in the West Bank, and the roadside ambushes which killed eight Jewish motorists along the main route between Jerusalem and Ramallah. In the Gaza Strip, the Israelis accuse Force 17 of mounting mortar attacks. On February 14 Israeli helicopter gunships fired a volley of rockets at a the car of a Force 17 colonel in the Gaza Strip, the second member of the force to be assassinated. Another member of the force was shot dead by Israeli forces in clashes in the Gaza Strip yesterday in which two Palestinian teenagers also died. Force 17 emerged in the mid-1970s and takes its name from the telephone extension of its founder, Ali Hassan Salameh, in the Palestinian headquarters in the Fak'hani district of west Beirut. To Palestinians, Salameh was a legendary figure. Married to a Lebanese beauty queen crowned Miss Universe, he inspired a character in the John Le Carré novel The Little Drummer Girl. But Israelis regard him as one of their most dangerous enemies: the man responsible for the attack on their athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. He was assassinated by an Israeli car bomb in 1979. But the force he created survived: a commando unit with unquestioned loyalty to Mr Arafat and other leaders of his Fatah movement. After three months of physical and arms training, members of Force 17 are routinely stationed away from their hometowns and isolated from their families to assure undivided loyalty to the Palestinian leader. When Mr Arafat returned to Gaza in 1994, 300 Force 17 fighters came too, and this nucleus of battle-hardened veterans from Lebanon remains the core of the militia, believed to number 3,500. Mahmoud Damara, the low-profile chief of Mr Arafat's presidential guard in Ramallah, describes his men as the ""first circle of defence around the Palestinian leader"". ""The Israelis have clearly targeted President Arafat and Force 17,"" Mr Damara said yesterday as he stood besides the unit's flattened buildings. ""But we expect anything from them. This is a war government."" In return, the Israeli army claims that Mr Damara has supplied his force's members with arms and defined the policies for terrorist attacks. Mr Damara denies any such role. ""Our duty is to defend the president,"" he told the Associated Press news agency. But, despite Force 17's reputation, many of the new recruits are of a far lower calibre than Israel imagines. Outside a branch office of Force 17 in neighbouring Beituniya yesterday, there was a single sentry: Ibrahim al-Nafar, a scrawny 18-year-old in plain clothes. The Gazan youth, who is paid £160 a month plus room and board, said he was left behind when his comrades were told to disperse for fear of Israeli follow-up attacks. Mr Arafat, whose appearances in the West Bank have been rare since the uprising began, was in defiant mood yesterday. But he faced a new call from President George Bush to condemn the suicide bombs which provoked the air attacks on Ramallah and Gaza. ""The Palestinian leader needs to speak out publicly and forcefully in a language the Palestinians can understand to condemn the violence and terror,"" Mr Bush said. But a threat of a further violence was made by Ahmad Helles, Fatah's secretary general in Gaza. ""If they hit our cities and civilians, then every place in Israel is a legitimate target for our fighters,"" he said.

world/2001/mar/18/mcveigh.usa,Relatives split by Oklahoma execution,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/18/mcveigh.usa,"A bitter dispute has broken out among the survivors and relatives of the 1995 Oklahoma City blast over the impending execution of bomber Timothy McVeigh. As McVeigh's death date draws closer, the minority of families who disagree with capital punishment are being ostracised. Some are now too afraid to express their views for fear of retribution. Emmett Welch, whose 23-year-old daughter Julie was one of the 168 who died in the April 1995 bombing of the Alfred P Murrah federal building, has been sent hate mail and marginalised from the survivors' association after speaking out against capital punishment. McVeigh, 32, who has never admitted guilt, is on death row in Indiana and is due to be executed by lethal injection on 16 May, the first federal prisoner to be put to death in the US since 1963. The Gulf war veteran has waived his rights to further appeals. His only chance of clemency rests with President George Bush, an advocate of capital punishment. The president at the time of the bombing, Bill Clinton, called for the death penalty within eight hours of the explosion. One of McVeigh's co-conspirators, Terry Nichols, is serving life imprisonment, but Oklahoma is about to spend £3 billion to retry him under state laws so that the death penalty can also be invoked for him. The emotive case is a major setback to anti-death penalty campaigners, turning back what had been a growing tide of disquiet among Americans over capital punishment. 'A thirst for vengeance is so driving people here that they are poisoning themselves with it,' said Welch. 'I know one woman who - well, they'd better cut off one of McVeigh's ears and send it to her: she's so hellbent on seeing this man die. 'I know another woman who's aged 20 years in the past five. They need this execution. But rage and vengeance just destroys you, I know, I felt that way for the first year or so. That's what drove McVeigh. He was raging against the government - that's why this happened. But Americans are slow to learn. 'Killing him isn't helping anyone, I try to tell the survivors it doesn't bring anyone back - but they just treat me like the freak.' Five other survivors told The Observer they backed Welch, but would not go on record. One woman said: 'I'm sorry to say I've lied in the face of the others. I'm not going to stand up and say ""That boy shouldn't die"" because they'd be looking to lynch me.' The split has been cemented by last month's opening of a new memorial centre next to the site of the bombed building. Among its exhibits is a buckled steel door and the broken and battered belongings of visitors and staff inside it. The centre also shows TV footage from the day, as well as eyewitness reports and emergency services' tapes. It includes a display on a successful campaign led by Glen Seidl and Diane Leonard, whose spouses died, to speed up the appeals process associated with capital punishment. Leonard went to Washington to lobby politicians before McVeigh had been convicted. 'We decided that this immense tragedy called for a positive aggressive response,' she said. 'I didn't want a killer sitting comfortably on death row for 17 years when we'd give anything for 17 minutes with our loved ones.' But Welch and anti-death penalty groups like Amnesty International believe applause for their efforts is a political statement out of place in a memorial. 'How many of those 168 people would want another death? I don't know and they don't know,' said Welch. A spokeswoman for the centre said Welch was 'out on a limb'. The majority of Oklahoma people share the views of Peggy Broxterman, whose 43-year-old son died. 'I do feel a little bit of sadness for his [McVeigh's] dad and sister,' she said. 'But as for the punishment, I'm thrilled to death. It's a big, big burden off my heart and when he dies I feel I can get on with life.' The emotional toll on Oklahoma City has been high. About 20 per cent of its population knew a victim or knew someone affected by the massive 4,800lb homemade bomb. The victims ran into thousands: hundreds were injured, and there have been several related suicides. Ajamu Baraka, director of Amnesty International's US anti-death penalty programme, said: 'We have been expecting some national backlash but we feel strongly that on principal we must be as visible in the McVeigh case as any other.'",2001-03-18T02:23:28Z,"{'polarity': 0.02004476584022037, 'subjectivity': 0.44162878787878784}",0.44162878787878784
world/2001/feb/05/michaelellison,Islanders take on US navy,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/05/michaelellison,"The inhabitants of a Caribbean island which the US navy has used for 60 years as a bombing range, including firing depleted uranium shells, are seeking $100m (£68m) in damages for an abnormally high cancer rate. Figures compiled in 1990-94 show that the 9,300 islanders of Vieques are 27% more likely to get cancer than those on Puerto Rico, just to the west. But Dr Rafael Rivera-Castao, who lives on the island, says the rate has risen since then. ""I estimate that the cancer rate here is now 52% more than the Puerto Rico average."" The navy says the island offers the only terrain suitable for its military exercises. John Arthur Eaves, the lawyer pressing for damages for one-third of islanders, said ""I think $100m may turn out to be at the lower end of the scale of what we might get from the navy. ""We have already spent $7m on preparing this case, which we wouldn't have done if we didn't think we had a very good chance of winning."" Nilda Medina, of the Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques, said: ""For years we have denounced the relationship between the military contamination and the exaggerated levels of cancer on Vieques. ""The heavy metals and other chemical components from explosives dangerous to human health combined with the radioactive uranium projectiles jeopardise the life of Viequenses today as well as future generations."" There was no way to guarantee that the next bomb would not hit one of the uranium shells, dispersing radioactive particles into the air. Vieques became a cause célèbre 21 months ago after a misdirected shell killed a civilian security guard, and became the catalyst for a re-examination of Puerto Rican relations with the US. Puerto Rico has been a territory for more than a century and its commonwealth status gives islanders US citizenship, albeit with reduced rights and duties: they cannot vote in presidential elections and do not have to pay federal taxes. In the most recent referendum on the issue they rejected the idea of becoming the 51st state, but few of them have any interest in independence, despite a new Puerto Rican self-confidence reflected in the success of its sportsmen and such musicians as Ricky Martin. Anti-American slogans are daubed throughout Vieques, an 18-mile long island on which civilians are confined to the middle third. Yesterday, as every Sunday, protesters rallied in the main town, Isabel Segunda, before driving in a convoy around the island blowing car horns and protesting through loudhailers. Quite apart from the indignity of their existence on a virtually occupied land, they claim that the navy's presence prevents the development of the island, where tourism is among the few sources of income. The bombing was halted after the death of the security guard when dissidents camped out on the range, defying the US and its allies, including Britain, to carry on. They were removed last May after an agreement with Bill Clinton for a referendum in November on whether the navy should stay or go in 2003. President Bush, eager to show empathy with Hispanics, said he would respect the deal. Bombing resumed last year, but with dummy shells. Puerto Rico's new governor, Sila Calderon, who took office last month, campaigned on an anti-navy platform and tried to persuade Mr Clinton in the last days of he presidency to halt the bombing for good. Ms Calderon has threatened to remove Puerto Rican guards from the entrance to the firing range and to hold an earlier, rival referendum. She says the bombing noise has produced an usually high rate of heart disease.",2001-02-05T01:30:31Z,"{'polarity': 0.08915223665223662, 'subjectivity': 0.3778354978354978}",0.3778354978354978
world/2001/mar/28/israel5,Israel vows to avenge killing of baby,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/28/israel5,"Israel's prime minister Ariel Sharon vowed last night to take decisive action to avenge the death of a baby girl killed by a sniper's bullet and a twin bombing in Jerusalem yesterday. As the parents of 10-month-old Shalhevet Pass refused to bury their daughter until Mr Sharon invades Palestinian-ruled land near the Jewish enclave of Hebron, rightwing politicians called for a tough response to a suicide attack on a bus in the French Hill settlement, northern Jerusalem, which killed the bomber and injured more than 30 people. ""Considering the events which have taken place, we should have no more restraint,"" said Jerusalem's rightwing mayor, Ehud Olmert. However, Israeli soldiers may find themselves accused of lacking any restraint following the death of an 11-year-old Palestinian boy near Hebron yesterday. A cousin said the boy was watching a firefight between Palestinian gunmen and Israeli soldiers when he was shot from the Israeli position. Doctors in Hebron hospital said Mahmoud Ismail Daraweesh was shot in the heart. The Israeli army said it had no information on the death near Dura, south of Hebron, but confirmed that its soldiers had traded fire with Palestinian gunmen at the nearby Al-Fawwar refugee camp. Mr Sharon did not immediately reveal his hand yesterday. ""I know how to deal with this, and when to deal with this,"" he told Israel Radio before entering deliberations with his security cabinet last night. ""The first priority of my government is to restore security to the citizens of Israel. Be patient, and watch the results."" The French Hill blast came barely five hours after four people were lightly injured by a pipe bomb in a car that exploded during the morning rush hour in the industrial area of Talpiot, the latest in a spate of bombings inside the Jewish state. ""I heard a strong boom, and came outside. Then I saw lots of black smoke, and the body of the bomber,"" said Lily Avias, who lives in French Hill. ""It was cut in half."" But the explosions, which were claimed by a variety of Palestinian militant organisations, failed to dislodge the attention of Israelis from the death of Shalhevet Pass. In Hebron, the local army commander, Colonel Noam Tibon, said he had asked Mr Sharon for permission to invade the spiny ridge of Abu Sneineh, the Palestinian-ruled neighbourhood that is the suspected source of the gunfire that killed the baby. ""The solution is to take the hill,"" he d said. Re-occupying Palestinian-ruled land would represent a dangerous escalation in the six-month intifada, and put Israel on a collision course with the international community. It is also inconvenient for Mr Sharon because of the Arab summit under way in Jordan. But the Jewish settlers, who claim rabbinical sanction for delaying the infant's burial in defiance of religious custom, are demanding precisely that. ""I think today the blood is very hot in Hebron, and sometimes people are looking for some kind of friction,"" said Col Tibon. ""The whole situation now is very dangerous ... the main problem now is friction, people seeking revenge."" The morning after Shalhevet's death brought ugly scenes to Hebron, where 400 Jewish settlers live in mutual hatred with 120,000 Palestinians. Amid the clatter of gunfire from the hills of Abu Sneineh, settlers stomped over the shells of the Palestinian-owned market stalls that they had torched overnight. In one shop, schoolgirls painted a memorial mural to the dead baby in fiery reds and oranges, with a passage from the Song of Songs: ""Love is stronger than death"". An Islamic trust building was also burnt. An armour-clad policewoman blinked back tears as a woman settler accused the security forces of failing to protect the enclave, screaming: ""Do you want me to come back with Shalhevet's bloody shirt and rub it in your face?"". A young settler wearing a T-shirt with Hebrew letters reading: ""I only buy from Jews"" joined a charge up the hill to Abu Sneineh before being beaten back by cordons of security forces. Mr Sharon has been a deep disappointment to the settlers of Hebron for his failure to unleash the full might of the Israeli army against Palestinian militias. ""Sharon talks big, but we are not interested in talk, we want him to act big. There is a limit to how much we can wait, and he is pushing our patience,"" he added. There were similar demands at the junction of French Hill yesterday where onlookers crowded for a view of the bus which the suicide bomber had tried to board before setting off the lethal cargo strapped to his waist. ""I think the government should close off the territories until the Palestinians feel the pinch in their pockets and are starving,"" said Mike Ebra, a resident of the militant Jewish settlement of Ofra. Others who witnessed the blast pleaded for understanding. ""I think we have to make peace the best way,"" Lily Aivas, a court clerk on maternity leave, said. ""Otherwise, they are killed, and we are killed.""",2001-03-28T02:14:05Z,"{'polarity': -0.00434654234654235, 'subjectivity': 0.3494871794871795}",0.3494871794871795
world/2001/apr/14/israel,Family olive groves fall to Israeli attacks,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/14/israel,"Ahmed Kasem, a Palestinian olive-farmer, enjoys curling up for a nap in the shade of one of his trees. When he is not dozing, he wanders round the olive groves, as he has done for most of his 76 years, watering the trees or tucking a little more earth round their roots to protect them from the sun. He lives in Huwwarah amid a pretty landscape of cypress, pine and olive trees a few miles south of Nablus, on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Olive trees have been cultivated in this part of the world since the Romans. On the hillsides above his home, there are olive trees that were planted 1,000 years ago that still produce olives. Closer to home, he can point to trees that were planted by his father 100 years ago. He loves the olive tree. ""For me, being with the trees is like being in heaven. I am not crazy but I open my heart to the trees. I think of the trees as I do my family. I speak to them when I have troubles."" He has had plenty of troubles to share with the trees in the past seven months. The olive branch, the universal symbol of peace, has fallen victim to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as have Mr Kasem and his fellow villagers. The Israeli army and Jewish settlers living nearby have been uprooting the olive trees. Mr Kasem lost 20 of them when an olive grove was bulldozed by the Israeli army in December. ""It was four in the morning. A neighbour knocked on the door. I rushed out almost naked. They had gone by the time I got there. The field was churned up, the trees lying all over the place,"" Mr Kasem said. ""I took the roots home. They are in the yard. I look at them every day. I say to them 'I spent half my life nurturing you'. I will keep the roots to remind my grandchildren what the Jews did to me and to them."" Although he has other olive trees, the loss was painful. ""Even if you have lots of kids, the death of one is going to hurt,"" he says. ""I planted those trees when I was only 20. It was the start of the winter season. I bought them at a village near Tel Aviv and took them home in my brother's truck."" The destruction of the olive groves is continuing at Huwwarah. Sixty other olive-farmers in the village have suffered losses: they estimated 2,500 olive trees have been torn up by the Israeli army or Jewish settlers. Two weeks ago the Palestinian Authority announced that in the past seven months 25,000 olive trees had been uprooted in the West Bank and Gaza. Major Yarden Vatichai, an Israeli army spokesman, said: ""We do it because there is a threat to our soldiers and civilians. They can be a hideout for Palestinian gunmen."" Most of the trees uprooted have been close to Jewish settlements, or beside roads used by Jewish settlers. Israeli peace groups, some of whose members have been arrested trying to stop the destruction, dispute the army version and claim the real reason for the uprooting is to aid the further Israeli annexation of Palestinian land. Palestinians, such Mr Kasem, see the loss of the olive trees as part of a deliberate policy by Israel to humiliate them, to sap their will. The mayor of Huwwarah, Wajeeh Odeh, 44, admitted that Palestinian youths have thrown stones at Jewish settlers using the road but said the Israeli response had been disproportionate. ""The kids throw stones to demonstrate their opposition to the occupation,"" he said. ""There have been no Palestinian snipers here. No soldier or settler has been killed or wounded."" One of the toughest parts of life under Israeli occupation is the curfew. The first and longest imposed by the army on Huwwarah lasted 38 days, beginning on October 6. It was a 24-hour curfew. There have been two others since. ""We were not allowed to leave our homes,"" one of Mr Kasem's neighbours, Mustapha Dawoud, said. ""It was like being a pigeon in a cage."" Closure of the village to the outside world has been near constant. Israeli checkpoints at either side of the village ensure a safe passage for Jewish settlers but they cut off access for the Palestinians. There are ways round, using desert by-pass roads, but locals use these at the risk of being shot. ""I took a risk,"" Mr Kasem said. ""I got a lorry and a driver and got some of the crop through."" He is confident that one day, God willing, there will be a Palestinian state and that the Israeli army and the settlers will be gone. He will safely replant new trees then. ""If not me,"" he says, ""my children or grandchildren will.""

world/2001/apr/13/israel2,Trouble in store for war-scarred sons of Gaza,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/13/israel2,"A generation of children are growing up in Gaza scarred by severe trauma and addicted to violence, according to a leading Palestinian psychiatrist, who fears that they threaten the fabric of future Palestinian society. ""You see children with no hope for the future, not skilled because their schooling has been so disrupted, quite desperate,"" says Dr Eyad el-Sarraj. ""Their parents transmit a continuous message of helplessness, fear, anxiety, deep despair in their eyes. The children feel totally unprotected and see that their parents are powerless. ""Every day they receive confusing messages from Palestinian television. In the morning the message is fight the Israelis, in the evening the message is look at the dead bodies and terrible wounds of those who fought today, and these are pictures nobody can tolerate."" Traumatised Dr Sarraj, who was trained in hospitals in London and Alexandria and has a distinguished record of publications, is the chairman of Gaza's community mental health programme. ""Every single person who lives in Gaza is traumatised to one degree or another,"" he says. His programme, with 220 employees, including 12 doctors and 15 psychologists, has treated 11% of the estimated 1m Palestinians living in Gaza. About 30% of the people in the occupied territory have heard about its work, especially with children. Gaza is a society of children: half the population is below the age of 14. ""These children very often have to cope with a father who has been subjected to Israeli violence, especially difficult if he has been tortured by the Israelis. Or they have fathers humiliated by long-term unemployment,"" Dr Sarraj says. ""In our culture the father always comes home with something to eat; even if he visits his sister or his cousin he must take something; but now men have nothing, literally. ""The story of the man who drove his bus into that group of soldiers in Tel Aviv recently was just this anger and despair. Such a man comes home and projects his anger against the family, particularly against the children. The child has lost the security framework which was his father."" Dr Sarraj explains the terrifying psychology behind Palestinian children's games. ""To get rid of fear you engage it, to get rid of the fear of dying you engage death. These children are playing an exciting and addictive game with death, and addictive is just what it is."" He has recorded how, after the first intifada, which ended in 1993, children played in the streets, pretending to be Arabs and Jews trying to kill each other. ""The children have switched their identification from their father to the Israelis. They prefer to play the Jew in the game because he is the powerful one. They have seen how their own fathers have lost the symbol of power."" In a survey of 3,000 children in the first intifada, 45% said they had seen their fathers being beaten by the Israelis. It is not only children who dice with death. ""There is communal fear and people deal with it by denial - they go up on the rooftops to watch the bombardments, saying, we don't care what happens to us,"" Dr Sarraj says. ""The bombardments are completely terrifying, massive explosions. I've thought Gaza would be flattened as I listened to it - just try to imagine the impact on children."" Humiliation The Israelis systematically transmit the devastating message that Palestinians are not human, he says. ""'You are not a human being,' they say with their eyes full of contempt, and their daily humiliations, such as making the only entry and exit from Gaza for Palestinians in their daily routine to be over a river of sewage, which not one Jew or one Israeli would accept to cross even once, never mind twice a day."" Tens of thousands of Palestinians receive this dehumanising message every day, he says. ""This is what you are worth, no more than a piece of stone."" His vision of the future is extremely bleak. ""A new seed of hatred is sown every single day by the Israelis."" He describes his own society as one now unprepared for peace, culturally or educationally. ""If peace comes and the common enemy is removed, I fear the creation of a new enemy, chaos and violence, drug addiction - everything we have seen only in American movies."" Nevertheless, he says, Palestinians still have some resources which have not been eroded. ""Our mothers have a very strong role, they are very, very important symbols of security and the basis of the family, and our tribal tradition gives us the honour and obligation of solidarity. Gaza is very, very poor, but people survive by sharing - we have to at all levels.""

world/2001/jan/08/israel,Polls scare Barak into alliance with Peres,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/08/israel,"The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, turned at the weekend to a man he has sidelined for the past 18 months - Shimon Peres - to save him from defeat in the prime ministerial election on February 6. His belated interest in a rapprochement with the man awarded the Nobel peace prize for his efforts to bring peace to Israel was spurred by the opinion polls, which show the hardline challenger for the premiership, Ariel Sharon, winning half the votes. The momentum could increase today when tens of thousands of rightwingers, many of them flown in from the US and Europe, converge outside Jerusalem's ancient walls to protest against the a proposal in the current US peace plan for the area that would divide the Old City between Israel and the Palestinians. Mr Barak hopes that Mr Peres can help him persuade leftwingers and Arabs that he is still a peacemaker. But the prospect of a peace deal being agreed before Bill Clinton relinquishes the US presidency on January 20 seems all but dead, Israeli and Palestinian officials said yesterday. And any hope that the two sides might resume security cooperation soon was shrinking, too. Israeli officials accused Palestinian military intelligence of recruiting the Jordanian man who bombed a Tel Aviv bus last month. That accusation cast a shadow over the security talks in Cairo between the CIA director, George Tenet, and Israeli and Palestinian officials. The Israelis said the bomber, Abdallah Abu Jaber, a citizen of Jordan where Palestinians form a majority, was given the bomb by Palestinian agents in Nablus. He was working in Israel at the time. The peace camp is hugely disillusioned with Mr Barak, and Labour party activists are afraid that a low turnout or spoiled ballots may give Mr Sharon victory by default. Mr Barak's standing in the party is so low that he has to fend off calls from his cabinet ministers and a petition from party activists to step aside for Mr Peres. Yesterday he was reduced to telling Israel Radio that he would fight the election even if he had only four supporters. He is reaching out to Mr Peres as insurance. At the weekend the two appeared together on TV, promising to work for peace, just as Mr Peres worked with Yitzhak Rabin. ""The goal is not to become prime minister. It is to do the best for the state of Israel,"" Mr Peres said. The Israeli press has speculated that Mr Peres could be rewarded with the post of foreign minister, a giant step up from the ministry of regional cooperation, where he has been languishing in recent months. He is also reported to have been promised a leading role in the peace negotiations. ""I am not looking for a job,"" he maintained. ""I am convinced we have to work together for the good of the country."" The effort to unite the centre and left is intended to counter today's rightwing show of strength in Jerusalem. The organisers say they have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars abroad, provoking a debate on the right of Jews living outside Israel to influence policy. They have also roped in some high-powered supporters who accuse Mr Barak of betraying all Jews by contemplating compromises in Jerusalem. ""Jerusalem is the identity of all the Jewish people,"" said the sometime Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, who has helped to mobilise Israel's 1m Russian immigrants against concessions to the Palestinians. ""Our argument is that this government is out of step with the will of the people.""",2001-01-08T01:35:31Z,"{'polarity': 0.08630952380952381, 'subjectivity': 0.37092490842490844}",0.37092490842490844
world/2001/jan/05/johnhooper1,The terrorist's daughter whose vendetta shook German politics,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/05/johnhooper1,"An extraordinary vendetta by the daughter of a dead terrorist leader lies behind the dramatic public apology of Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, last night for his part in a violent assault on a policeman during a protest in the 1970s. Leading opposition politicians are demanding that the charismatic Green party chief step down. Mr Fischer said he wanted to make ""an apology for the wrongdoing to others"" he had perpetrated in his streetfighting days when he was a young leftwing militant. Photos published by Stern magazine and the tabloid daily Bild Zeitung showed him apparently luring a riot policeman into a violent ambush. The pictures were supplied to the papers by Bettina Röhl, whose mother was the terrorist leader Ulrike Meinhof. In a message posted on her personal website yesterday, Ms Röhl said she intended to follow up the publication of the photographs with the release of additional, allegedly compromising, material. The street clash ""will become sort of uncomfortable for its hero when I soon publish the Super 8 movie and other material which comes with it and which is complementary to the photos"", she said. Her message, written in lengthy, winding sentences, was shot through with bitterness towards Mr Fischer, whom she accused of trying to cover up his past on the far left. The foreign minister's record is soon to come under closer scrutiny than ever before. He has been summoned to give evidence later this month at the trial on terrorist charges of a former friend, Hans Joachim Klein. Ms Röhl claimed yesterday that he was one of the other attackers shown in the photographs. Mr Klein is accused of taking part in the mass kidnapping of Opec oil ministers in Vienna. in 1975. Stern said the photographs of the demonstration were taken in 1973 - two years earlier. Ms Röhl discovered the pictures while researching a book to be published later this year. The conservative daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said last night that they had been taken by a staff photographer and had lain in the paper's archives for 28 years. Ms Röhl's mother, one of two leaders of the infamous Baader-Meinhof Gang, committed suicide in prison in 1976. Mr Fischer, on the other hand, renounced violence and moved gradually into the political mainstream. Three years ago, he was named foreign minister after the Greens struck a coalition deal with Gerhard Schröder's Social Democrats. Though outside Germany he has recently became a hate figure for the right, because of his espousal of a federal Europe, inside Germany Mr Fischer is just as much of a hate figure for the left, who accuse him of betraying his radical principles. In 1999, after he sided with Nato's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, Mr Fischer suffered a burst eardrum when an enraged fellow-Green hurled a paint bomb at him. His role in radical far-left politics and among squatters in Frankfurt, where he was a student, has long been known. But he had rarely spoken in detail about it before talking to Stern's interviewers. ""We squatted houses and when they were supposed to be cleared we defended ourselves,"" he said. ""We threw stones. We were beaten up but we also fought back strongly."" He added: ""Yes, I was militant. But I always rejected the armed struggle and fought it politically"".",2001-01-05T23:34:44Z,"{'polarity': -0.09084768659236744, 'subjectivity': 0.39343127321850724}",0.39343127321850724
world/2001/jun/25/terrorism,Fight or flight?,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/25/terrorism,"Last week I flew from Jordan to Britain, via Tel Aviv. Changing planes in Tel Aviv is not, as you might expect, a simple matter of getting off one plane and on to another. Arriving in the terminal building, I followed the signs saying ""transit"" and came to a locked door. ""You can't go in there, you have to go through immigration,"" an official said. ""But there's no need. My baggage has been checked straight through to London."" ""No, it hasn't. We don't do that in Israel."" And so I went to the immigration desk where they gave me a three-month tourist visa and wished me a pleasant stay. I was then greeted by a security official, who asked why I had been to Jordan and what I was planning to do during my stay in Israel. I explained that the purpose of my visit was to catch a plane to London. He eyed me suspiciously and suggested this was a rather odd thing to be doing in Tel Aviv airport. Retrieving my bag, I crossed from the arrivals hall to the departures hall, to be greeted by another security official, who asked what I had done during my stay in Israel. Fortunately, she was reassured to learn that I had spent almost my entire visit in the company of security officials. Puzzling over this surreal ritual on the flight to London, I wondered whether it had any real security purpose: if transit passengers pose a danger, why do other airports allow them? Another possibility is that it might be a way of inflating Israel's tourism statistics. Forcing transit passengers to pass through immigration would allow them to be counted as tourists, even if their sightseeing takes them no further than the duty free shops. My Guardian colleague, Martin Woollacott, had an even stranger experience some years ago when his plane stopped in Israel without intending to let any passengers on or off. Security officials boarded the plane, selected two passengers, apparently at random, and took them out on to the tarmac. Woollacott was one of them. Rummaging through his hand baggage, the official picked out some hair cream. He looked at it, crushed it with his foot, confirmed that it was (or rather had been) hair cream, and without a word of explanation sent Woollacott on his way. Talking to other colleagues, I found that almost everyone who has visited Israel has a story to tell about their attempts to enter or leave the country. Imogen Tilden was returning from an innocent week's sightseeing in Jerusalem: ""I had the extensive questioning that everyone is subjected to (where did you go, describe what you saw, what buses did you travel on?) but they didn't seem happy, and demanded I follow them to a side room. ""I was told to take my shoes and socks off, which they took away to be scanned. They then took both my bags and went through them, shaking out every piece of dirty underwear and flicking through every book, and X-raying anything else. ""I was beginning to get really worried as three or four of them were urgently discussing me and my passport in whispers over the other side of the room, and I had no idea why I was deemed so suspicious. ""I was finally assigned an armed guard who stayed by my side until my flight left. When I asked to go to the toilet he had to find a female officer who escorted me there and waited outside my cubicle. The armed guard then escorted me through passport control, and saw me on to the plane. ""As far as I could tell, I was the only passenger on that plane to have an armed escort (great way to skip queuing). To this day I can't imagine why they got so agitated. I have no stamps from Muslim countries on my passport."" Mark Tallentire went on a last-minute bargain holiday to Eilat: ""I was amazed to be hauled over for questioning on the tarmac as I walked across to the terminal and be given the ultimate in cross examinations: why did you book so late, why did you come here? what do you do? ... prove it ... etc, etc. ""After about 20 minutes of this and having furnished them with four separate pieces of ID which were taken away to be checked, I was becoming increasingly exasperated,"" he says. He was then asked: ""Have you brought a weapon with you to defend yourself?"" To which he replied: ""No. I didn't realise I needed one."" Jewish visitors do not get in or out easily, either. Stephanie Kerstein and her partner were required by officials at Lod airport to prove that they were, in fact, Jewish: ""They ask men to recite their Barmitzvah portion, which is the section of the law a boy recites in the synagogue on his Barmitzvah,"" she says. ""Apparently, this is something they never forget, like an army number. I saw the truth of this when my partner was word perfect in the words he had last said 30 years before."" Back in 1998, a man who gave his name as Tony Blair, and his occupation as a prime minister, ran into trouble at the checkpoint into Gaza. Despite the fact that he looked like Mr Blair (and was, indeed, the British prime minister on an official visit), and that he had a heavily armed Israeli escort which would have severely limited his opportunity to commit acts of terrorism, he had forgotten his passport. It took a great deal of effort to persuade the officials to let him through. The question that arises from all this is how much is necessary for effective security, how much is for theatrical display, and how much is meant to intimidate. Nobody objects to sensible questions such as ""did you pack these bags yourself?"" but when the questions appear irrelevant or intrusive, people simply lie or give fatuous answers. Stephanie Kerstein recalls that a man in her queue for the check-in, apparently irritated by the whole process, quipped that he had a bomb in his pocket. He was immediately marched off and was not seen on the plane. Returning from a previous visit last November, I produced credentials - recognised by the Israeli foreign ministry, to show that I was a bona fide journalist. That should have been enough for security purposes, but I was then asked if I was carrying any notes from interviews, or copies of articles I had written. I replied that I had thrown away my notes and had sent all my articles to London without keeping copies. This, I discovered later, is a normal line of inquiry where visiting journalists are concerned. Another question which many people, not just journalists, are asked is: ""Have you met any Arabs?"" The correct answer to this is ""no"", unless you have an hour or two to spare. The most interesting answer, which a colleague claims to have given, is: ""How should I know? You all look the same to me."" I have not yet come across anyone who has been interrogated in a similar way about contacts with Israeli troublemakers, such as vigilante settlers. The question, implying that Arabs in general are a security risk, is fundamentally racist and would not be tolerated in any other developed country. Imagine the fuss if passengers leaving Heathrow were routinely asked: ""Have you met anyone with an Irish accent?""

world/2001/feb/09/israel1,"Sharon and Barak meet, West Bank flares up",World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/09/israel1,"Israeli prime minister-elect Ariel Sharon met today with caretaker premier Ehud Barak to discuss the transition of power, as violence escalated with Palestinians and Israeli soldiers exchanging gunfire in the West Bank. Mr Sharon's first priority is to form a government and at his meeting today with Mr Barak, the two discussed the possibility of a government of national unity. ""Barak informed Sharon of the latest developments in diplomatic and security issues,"" said a spokesman from the prime minister's office, where the two met for an hour. During the meeting Mr Sharon renewed his offer to Mr Barak to keep his position of defence minister in the incoming government. Mr Barak, however, announced his resignation from parliament after his loss to Sharon in Tuesday's election by a 25% margin. Both Mr Barak and former Labour prime minister Shimon Peres have indicated support for a national unity government with Mr Sharon so long as he pursues peace. Mr Barak's peace deal, however, looks dead. Mr Sharon has said he will not be bound by negotiations that were happening with the outgoing government. In words that rang even truer after a car bomb exploded yesterday in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighbourhood of Jerusalem, the Palestinians said today that the next few weeks would be ""a test"" of the peace process. Nabil Abu Rudeina, a senior adviser to the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, said: ""The change in the US administration and the change in Israel require a change in methods and contents. The next few weeks will be a test of the extent to which the peace process can go,"" he added. The US president, George Bush, has abandoned Middle East peace plans championed by his predecessor, Bill Clinton, and has indicated that his administration will take a far more hands-off approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Mr Sharon is ""encouraged"" that the Bush administration has distanced itself with the compromise peace proposals set forth by Mr Clinton, a spokesman for Mr Sharon said today. He added that Mr Clinton himself told Mr Sharon that his peace compromises were not binding if the Israelis and Palestinians did not reach an accord before his administration left office. Mr Barak had in principle accepted the Clinton plan, which called among other things for some Palestinian sovereignty in Jerusalem. Mr Sharon has said he will not consider a peace plan that divides Jerusalem. However the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, told Mr Sharon that he risked increasing violence if he did not stick to the understanding reached by the previous Israeli government. A statement issued by the presidency and published by Egyptian newspapers today said Mr Mubarak congratulated Sharon on his victory, but warned of dire consequences if the Arab-Israeli peace talks collapsed, adding that an attempt to ""ignore the achievements of the peace process on any track"" would trigger further tension. Illustrating the point, an intense gun battle erupted between Israeli troops and Palestinians near the West Bank town of Ramallah. Israeli soldiers aimed machine gun fire at empty high-rise apartment buildings used by Palestinian gunmen as cover. And in the Gaza Strip, the Islamic militant group Hamas threatened to carry out more suicide attacks against Israel. Some 2,500 Hamas supporters chanted ""Destroy the centre of Tel Aviv"" and burned effigies of Mr Sharon and Mr Bush. One Hamas banner held up by the crowd read ""Generals like Sharon only understand the language of resistance and holy war.""

world/2001/apr/18/israel3,Israel forced to pull out of Gaza after outcry,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/18/israel3,"Israel's hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon, was last night forced to order out his tanks from territory recaptured from the Palestinians in Gaza, in the face of unprecedented international condemnation. Only hours after a senior Israeli army general promised that the military occupation could last for weeks or even months, news agencies reported that the withdrawal had started. Mr Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, claimed that this was according to plan: ""We always said that it will happen when the military operation ends,"" he said. The apparent about-turn followed an unusually out spoken intervention by the American secretary of state, Colin Powell, who accused the Israeli army of an ""excessive and disproportionate"" response to Palestinian mortar attacks. Mr Powell said that Israel was failing to uphold its commitment under the Oslo accords of 1993 which awarded Palestinians control of designated areas of Gaza. ""The situation is threatening to escalate further, posing the risk of a broader conflict,"" he said. The operation to reoccupy the Palestinian-controlled territory around the town of Beit Hanoun - in northern Gaza - had commenced before dawn yesterday when Israeli tanks began shelling outlying Palestinian border posts north and east of the town. A Palestinian border guard was killed by a direct hit from a rocket, and 36 people were hurt. Later in the day, two Palestinian youths, aged 10 and 14, were killed in separate shooting incidents in Gaza involving Israeli soldiers. At Beit Hanoun, Palestinian officials said Israeli troops thrust a kilometre inside Palestinian territory, bulldozing or rocketing four police posts. They razed houses and citrus trees in the most fertile part of a pitifully overcrowded and parched territory, and dug a trench to seal off the northern hinterland from the town centre. The move was met by instant outrage. The Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, said peace efforts were dead. ""I don't see any possibility of success this way,"" he said. ""What happened was an unforgiveable crime,"" Mr Arafat said, arriving in the West Bank city of Ramallah from Jordan. ""These raids are not just an escalation but they are dirty and are intended to bring our people to their knees."" Israel's stated justification for the action was to protect Israeli citizens from mortar fire from inside Gaza. Brigadier General Yair Naveh - the commander of the army's Gaza brigade who predicted the occupation could last months - said it was a defensive operation. ""Its aim is to create and stabilise a line that will enable our citizens, in Sderot and other communities in the area, to sleep peacefully,"" he said. On Monday night, five mortar shells had landed on the edges of Sderot, a development town inside the borders of Israel which lies just up the road from the farm belonging to Mr Sharon. Israel said the mortars were fired from Beit Hanoun. From yesterday's events, it had appeared the army was intent on widening its security perimeter inside the borders of the Gaza Strip. Under the Oslo accords, Palestinian security forces cannot patrol within 500 metres of Gaza's borders with the Jewish state without Israeli army permission. But that security cordon does not provide protection from long-range mortars. The Islamist militant group Hamas claimed the attack on Sderot but Gen Naveh, echoing previous Israeli charges, said the strike bore the ""fingerprints of the Palestinian Authority"". The attack, the latest in a spate of mortar strikes, caused no damage or injuries, but Israel said the targeting of a town within the borders of the Jewish state was unacceptable. ""This is unjustified and crosses the line,"" the foreign minister, Shimon Peres, told Israel radio. ""There's a limit to everything."" Israel had threatened repeatedly in recent weeks that it would retake some Palestinian-controlled areas if the escalation in violence continued. Israeli troops entered Palestinian-ruled areas in Gaza three times during the last week, and its bulldozers regularly razed farm land and houses. It has shelled Palestinian police posts - as it did in Beit Hanoun yesterday morning, and in Gaza City overnight on Monday, where eight security installations were hit. For the last six years, the people of Beit Hanoun have lived under the Oslo agreement and under autonomous Palestinian control. They have had virtually no contact with Israel, or its army, unless they tried to leave the territory. For several hours yesterday they were back under occupation - indefinitely as it then seemed. As the troop withdrawal began last night, it was still unclear whether the Israeli army would quit other strategic parts of Gaza that it had captured yesterday. Soldiers sealed off the road at two junctions, effectively slicing the territory into three pieces and cutting off Gaza City from its hinterland. They also closed the Rafah border crossing to Egypt. ""The Israeli soldiers are trying to get as close as they can to the Palestinians, and to cut off as much of their movement as they can, without putting themselves at risk,"" a foreign diplomat said. ""They do not want to go back to the first intifada in the 1980s when they were holding on to densely populated Palestinian towns.""

world/2001/jan/20/johnaglionby1,Filipinos rally to oust the president,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/20/johnaglionby1,"Thousands of protesters marched to the presidential palace in Manila in the early hours of this morning after the collapse of the government of President Joseph Estrada in the Philippines. Television reported that police fired warning shots near the palace to keep protesters away and to make sure demonstrators did not clash with a small number of Estrada supporters. The powerful Roman Catholic church in the Philippines had earlier announced that it would swear in the vice-president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, as the country's new president by midday local time today (4am British time), although it was later reported that the ceremony might be put back. The opposition had set noon as the new deadline for the resignation of Mr Estrada after he ignored an earlier deadline. According to an Estrada adviser, the president was still at the palace and wanted to stay in the Philippines. Ms Arroyo has already declared herself commander in chief of the army. Mr Estrada's government had been besieged by a people power movement utilising modern technology and voicing outrage at the former movie star's blatant attempts to sabotage his impeachment trial. Millions of ordinary Filipinos, communicating with each other via mobile phone text messages, swarmed on to the streets of the capital, Manila, in scenes reminiscent of the 1986 uprising which ousted the former dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The country's most senior generals and most of the cabinet deserted their beleaguered leader as more than 250,000 people demonstrated. Most people heard about the planned swearing-in of Ms Arroyo via the text messages, the same means that galvanised a spontaneous uprising on Tuesday evening, when Mr Estrada's impeachment trial collapsed after he bullied and bribed senators to block the admission of vital evidence. Within minutes ""Trial collapsed"" was whizzing round the phone networks, followed by messages abusing the senators as ""elements of evil"". All the messages ended with the same three words: ""Pass this on."" Then the first genesis of a protest movement emerged: ""Be angry _ Come outside at 11 [pm] and make noise."" ""Come to EDSA"" hit people's screens, referring to the shrine built on the site of the 1986 demonstrations. ""Wear black because we're mourning the death of truth and justice,"" was the next command. ""No one knew where these messages originated,"" said Narzalina Lim, a civil society leader and minister under former president Corazon Acquino, who replaced Marcos in 1986. ""They just appeared and within an hour or two tens of thousands of people had gathered. It really was people power in action as there was no obvious leader to make the calls."" The tone of the messages changed on Wednesday as people feared retaliation and retribution from Mr Estrada and his cronies. Bomb scares, fake assassination attempts and warnings about coups were the most common alarms. By yesterday the crowd at the shrine had swollen to more than a quarter of a million, while the pro-Estrada rally numbered about 3,000. The first development yesterday was news that several thousand pro-Estrada supporters had descended on the business district and had clashed briefly with anti-Estrada office workers there. The impeachment affair, which broke last October when a provincial governor, Luis Singson, went public with accusations that Mr Estrada had siphoned off millions of pounds from illegal gambling scams, almost brought the economy to its knees. On the news that the government had collapsed, the Philippine currency rallied from almost 56 pesos to the US dollar to almost 47. Then came news that the country's military chief, General Angelo Reyes, had withdrawn his support for Mr Estrada, followed by a slew of other generals, police chiefs and ministers. Only a tiny hardcore of fanatical loyalists remained at the president's side. The text message doing the rounds late last night said it all: ""I guess we've won again.""",2001-01-20T02:31:06Z,"{'polarity': 0.021158958001063256, 'subjectivity': 0.3803739145844409}",0.3803739145844409
world/2001/apr/18/israel1,Sharon's breach of Oslo was step too far,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/18/israel1,"""The Israelis crossed a red line today,"" said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian who was involved in the peace process. ""Oslo is dead."" He was commenting after the Israeli army breached the historic Oslo agreement by occupying territory in the Gaza Strip that had been handed over to autonomous Palestinian control - the so-called Area A - and before the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, announced last night that Israel was pulling pull out. Mr Khatib's pessimism was matched by his counterparts on the Israeli side who helped negotiate the Oslo agreement - signed by the Israelis and Palestinians seven years ago. But Yossi Beilin, a Labour member of parliament who was part of the Israeli delegation at Oslo did not stop believing that the principles that shaped the agreement were still valid. ""I see the conquering of part of Gaza as a big mistake. It is a deterioration of the situation. It deepens the hatred. The last thing we need to do is win the war. We would be back in all the places we wanted to leave,"" he said. He had accused the Israeli prime minister, who decided late last night that the occupation should end quickly, of living in the 1950s, a time when Mr Sharon believed retaliation to be an effective response to Palestinian attacks. In 1955, Mr Sharon led two paratroop companies into Gaza in an operation codenamed Black Arrow that destroyed the Egyptian army headquarters then based there, killing 37 Egyptian soldiers and wounding 31. It is not even two months since Mr Sharon became prime minister, but in that short time the crisis in the Middle East has deepened. Attitudes on both sides have hardened, and the threat of a regional war has re-emerged. Mr Sharon began quietly, the policy of his first few weeks not that different from his predecessor, Ehud Barak. But, facing criticism from the Israeli right for not being tough enough on the Palestinians, who stepped up mortar attacks in the interim, Mr Sharon has opted for tough military action, seemingly in the belief that the Palestinians can be forced to accept a deal. No longer waiting to respond to Palestinian attacks, Mr Sharon in the last two weeks has gone for ""pre-emptive reprisals"": rocket and tank attacks on Palestinian areas, accompanied by bulldozers. And this week Mr Sharon went further, going into Area A in breach of the Oslo peace accord. In part two of the Oslo agreement, signed in 1995, the West Bank and Gaza were divided into three parts: Area A was to be fully under the control of the Palestinian Authority, which was to be responsible for all civil and security matters; Area B was to be under joint Israeli-Palestinian security control; and Area C was to be under Israeli control. Both sides blame one another for having breached Oslo. The Israelis say the Palestinians were to blame for failing to maintain the security necessary to prevent attacks on Israeli settlements. What the Israeli army risked doing with the occupation was make themselves targets in areas that the Palestinians had regarded as sovereign territory. A Palestinian minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo, had warned yesterday that the Palestinian Authority and its people would act in accordance with the reality of the ""re-occupation"" of Gaza. This implicit threat backed up the gloomy assessment of Mr Khatib, now a lecturer in political studies at Bir Zeit University in Ramallah, on the West Bank. He was part of the Palestinian delegation that took part in the Madrid summit and subsequent Washington talks that led to the Oslo agreement. He said he was appalled that the Israeli army had reoccupied a part of Gaza that had been ceded to the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo agreement, and was pessimistic about the chances for peace. ""We have a government in Israel that has policies that go against the legality and philosophy of Oslo. Sharon led the opposition to Oslo and he is now prime minister and has a coalition of people that includes people to the right,"" he said. He said the reoccupation had risked ""Palestinian reaction and resistance which will fuel the vicious circle of violence"". Ron Pundak, an Israeli who was involved in the secret negotiations that led to Oslo and is now head of an economic foundation based in Tel Aviv, said it was not a single event that was damaging Oslo but different and brutal events coming at different angles. It would require hindsight to see whether the agreement had been killed or not. He said there was a saying in Israel that ""every bastard is king"": every member of Hizbullah with a mortar could affect the lives of all Israelis and Palestinians, as could each Israeli soldier who shot at a high-level peace delegation, as happened a fortnight ago. What was needed was for the two societies and their leaders to understand one another. Mr Pundak said: ""I would judge the situation we are in as one of the lowest ebbs in the process since Oslo and it will not be the lowest we will come to in the next few months or more.""

world/2001/apr/03/worlddispatch.ameliagentleman,Moscow's media wavers on the edge,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/03/worlddispatch.ameliagentleman,"Brooding introspection has become the favourite theme for Russia's most influential weekly news analysis programme, Itogi. Broadcast in a primetime viewing position every Sunday night, the highbrow current affairs show has begun rushing through its reports on troubled events in Yugoslavia or Israel, and its analysis of political developments in Russia. This is to allow it to devote a large chunk of its two-hour slot to the internal problems unsettling the channel that airs it. Imagine an edition of Newsnight devoted to the future of the BBC, with Jeremy Paxman analysing his own career prospects in the event that the channel wound up its operation. Or think of Panorama dispatching its reporters to gather material for a report on the likelihood of the series being taken off the screen. Yet this is increasingly the tone of Itogi, presented by the highly-respected journalist Yevgeny Kiselyov, who is also the general director of NTV, the channel that broadcasts the programme. This week the navel-gazing extended to Kukly - Russia's version of Spitting Image. Political satire was abandoned in favour of more self-analysis, introducing a plastic puppet version of the Sunday news show, complete with a latex image of presenter Mr Kiselyov. With laboured symbolism, the script had the NTV studios on the verge of being destroyed by terrorist explosives, saved only by Russian president Vladimir Putin's rubber double, who stepped in at the last minute to defuse the ticking time bomb. This fascination with events at the headquarters of its own television station would be extremely tedious were it not for the issues apparently at stake. The future of NTV - Russia's only independent television network - in its current form has been in question now for almost a year and, later today, a decision at a boardroom meeting will determine whether key founding members of the staff will stay or be sacked. Senior executives from Media-Most - the media group that owns NTV - claim that the future of free speech in Russia depends on the decision. The complex twists of the Media-Most saga have become so tangled that the Russian public might have been forgiven for losing interest in its fate. But the tribulations of the network continue to attract attention and between 10,000 and 20,000 people turned out for a meeting in central Moscow on Saturday to protest at government-orchestrated attacks on the station. Rallied by a week of publicity in newspapers owned by Media-Most and on NTV's broadcasts, the protesters listened to a pop concert and heard liberal opposition politicians warning of the need to fight for press freedom. At the heart of the dispute is the Media-Most case - articulated by NTV's founder Vladimir Gusinsky - that the continuing government-initiated attempt to wrest back large loans from the company represents a deliberate attack on Russia's independent media. The Kremlin, Mr Gusinsky argues, was infuriated by NTV's coverage of the conflict in Chechnya and its criticism of Mr Putin's government, and is determined to stifle the station's dissenting voice. The Kremlin insists that this is a purely financial matter - Media-Most owes money, which must be repaid. Mr Gusinsky has also been charged with large-scale fraud in connection with the Media-Most empire. A meeting of shareholders has been called today by Alfred Kokh - the head of the media arm of the government-controlled natural gas giant Gazprom, which is owed debts of up to £210,641m by Media-Most. If the meeting goes ahead, Media-Most officials fear the session will initiate a vote for a new board of directors, which will result in the removal of their own staff members and their replacement with Kremlin-friendly substitutes. If these fears are realised, then today will prove a decisive landmark in the prolonged battle for control of the television network. Mr Gusinsky - who is under house-arrest in his villa in southern Spain, fighting an extradition request by Russian prosecutors - looks set to be ousted from the board of governors and has been doing his utmost to avert the board meeting. In the latest tortuous development, the High Court in London was due last week to rule on which side had the right to a contested block of 19% of crucial shares in Media-Most. The court decided that it was unable to make a ruling on the case. This meant that the shares remain frozen - and, ultimately, that Media-Most's 49% holding over NTV is reduced by 19%, giving Gazprom the decisive vote in questions of control (with 46% of the shares), thereby allowing them to replace influential figures like Mr Kiselyov as well as Mr Gusinsky. Also last week, Media-Most attempted, through a Russian court, to block Gazprom Media's decision to hold the extraordinary board meeting today; this legal action failed. Today, Mr Gusinsky and his team will be hoping that the Russian president echoes his puppet twin and steps in to avert the threat of NTV's destruction, but the chances of life imitating satire look slim. The Kremlin continues to insist that it plays no role in the dispute.

world/2001/feb/17/alqaida.terrorism,Defector lifts lid on the business of terror,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/17/alqaida.terrorism,"The scene outside the American embassy on a hot summer day in 1996 would have been a familiar one in a hundred different cities: a long line of aspiring emigrants waiting patiently at the visa window for a form to fill in or an appointment to make. But the nervous Sudanese man in the queue had something else in mind. ""I don't want visa,"" he said in broken English. ""But I have some information for your government... about people, they want to do something against your government."" That was over four years ago. We still do not know the location of the embassy - it remains secret for reasons of US national security - but we do know the name of the Sudanese man in the queue. It is Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl, and the people he wanted to warn the US embassy about were his former employers, Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda organisation. Mr al-Fadl, now 37 years old, has a new identity under a federal witness protection programme, along with $20,000 (£13,500) as starting capital for a new life. Since his defection, he has been referred to in official documents as CS1 (Confidential Source One). But he has resurfaced under his real name this month in New York as a star witness in the trial of four men accused of plotting, on Mr Bin Laden's orders, the 1998 bombing of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in which 224 people were killed. As he defected two years before the bombs went off, Mr al-Fadl can say nothing about the events of that bloody August in east Africa, but what he did provide in the Manhattan courtroom has been riveting none the less. As a founding member and trusted official in al-Qaeda (roughly translated as the Base), he was in a perfect position to give a comprehensive account of its far-reaching operations. He gave evidence in faded jeans and a white knitted skull cap. The court artist was not permitted to draw his portrait. Modern Like any other multinational enterprise in the era of globalisation, al-Qaeda appears to have diversified its product, producing roads and bridges as well as bombs and booby traps. It is arranged, not in an old-fashioned vertical hierarchy, but in a modern horizontally integrated array of loosely affiliated groups, drawing shared goals and philosophy from the centre but operating independently. It is as if Mr Bin Laden had been consulting the most up-to-date management gurus. What Mr al-Fadl had to say helped explain why his former boss appears so powerful and invincible and, paradoxically, why his sudden death or disappearance would be unlikely to stem the unpredictable violence in which al-Qaeda specialises. The most striking feature of Mr al-Fadl's testimony was all the banal detail of the nine-to-five grind of a career in terrorism. In al-Qaeda's offices in Khartoum, the boss sat in the first office on the left. There were board meetings, wage nego tiations and the firm took care of its employees' healthcare. There were perks for employees, such as free tea and groceries, and an in-house specialist for the interpretation of dreams. A travel department obtained tickets and passports to order. As in all multinational corporations, al-Qaeda appears to suffer from constant friction and mutual envy among the various national groups working for it. Mr al-Fadl had joined the organisation at the beginning, in Afghanistan in 1990, when Mr Bin Laden, the maverick heir to a Saudi construction fortune, decided to divert the money and resources he had poured into the mojahedin war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, and channel into a new jihad - against the ""snake"", the United States. Mr al-Fadl recalled Mr Bin Laden and his closest advisers issuing a fatwah against the US at the time of the Gulf war. He said: ""The fatwah, it say we cannot let the American army stay in the Gulf area and take our oil, take our money and we have to to do something to take them out. We have to fight them."" When the newly formed al-Qaeda decamped to Sudan on the invitation of a radical Islamic regime in Khartoum, Mr al-Fadl became a trusted employee. He once delivered $100,000 in cash to an al-Qaeda member in Jordan (where the organisation arranged for customs officers to overlook the dollar-stuffed bag), and on another occasion he was sent off with enough money to buy 50 camels to smuggle weapons into Egypt. But he bristled at the fact that the Egyptians in the organisation earned far more than his $500 a month and appeared to wield more clout. He confronted his boss with his complaints, but Mr Bin Laden told him the Egyptians were paid extra to help them visit their families back home. ""He say ... some people, they got citizenship from another country and they go back over there for regular life,"" Mr al-Fadl told the court. ""And he says that's why he try to make them happy and give them more money."" Mr al-Fadl was not appeased and decided to top up his salary himself, skimming off a total of $110,000 in the form of under-the-counter commissions for contracts awarded. He was caught, but Mr Bin Laden ordered him to repay the money in order to gain forgiveness. However, the world's most feared terrorist may have been too laid back for his own good. Mr al-Fadl could not repay the money and instead fled Sudan and ran into the arms of the CIA. He must have been a heaven-sent source for the agency with a detailed inside picture of Mr Bin Laden's organisation. By the time it reached the southern district court in Manhattan it was of course, already out of date. Mr Bin Laden has since decamped to Afghanistan, and the Sudanese operation has been rolled up. But Mr al-Fadl's testimony still says a lot about his organisational style. In Sudan, according to Mr al-Fadl, al-Qaeda had a board of directors, the Shura council, a panel of a dozen or so trusted lieutenants, which discussed and coordinated all the organisation's far-flung activities. Subordinate to the council were four executive committees: military, responsible for weapons and training; money and business, in charge of all al-Qaeda's commercial operations as well as personnel, salaries and healthcare; Islamic study, charged with maintaining the theological rigour of the organisation; and media, which ran a weekly newspaper. Its editor wrote under the ironic pen name of Abu Massad Reuter, in honour of the British news agency, Reuters. The organisation ran a network of money-making ventures in Sudan under an umbrella holding corporation called Wadi al-Aqiq, which Mr al-Fadl referred to as ""the mother of all companies"". Its subsidiaries included Ladin International, an import-export company; Taba investment; which traded currencies; Hijra Construction, a civil engineering company and Themar al-Mubaraka, which ran a farm growing sesame seeds, peanuts and corn. All these disparate enterprises were aimed at propagating al-Qaeda's core ""product"", jihad (or holy war). The commercial groups helped sustain Mr Bin Laden's fortune, which either financed al-Qaeda terrorist operations or sponsored a wide variety of like-minded groups from around the world, who came for weapons training and bomb-making instruction at the Themar al-Mubaraka farm in Sudan. Many of the trainees were Egyptians from the Islamic Jihad movement. Its leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri has emerged as Mr Bin Laden's deputy. Other al-Qaeda clients have included Filipino Muslim separatists, Algerians (like the Montreal cell broken up last year after Ahmed Ressam tried to smuggle explosives over the US border near Seattle) and Yemenis (like the group that carried out the boat-bomb attack on the USS Cole). 'Franchise' There were also Arab Americans like two of the defendants in the New York trial: Wahid el-Hage, the manager of a shop in Dallas and Ali Mohamed, an Egyptian-born former US army sergeant who was assigned to instruct special forces on Islamic politics and culture. It turns out that he remained an agent for Egyptian Islamic Jihad. All these cells operated on their own, but they looked for money, training and direction to the centre and al-Qaeda. ""In corporate terms, it's not IBM but more like a franchise, like Kentucky Fried Chicken,"" Brian Jenkins, a US terrorism expert, said. ""One of the trends we have seen in terrorism organisations in the last 10 years is that they have become a lot more fluid. There are a lot more networks than the more traditional hierarchies. Al-Qaeda has done away with layers of middle management, but its still able to maintain its 'brand'."" This ""branding"", Mr Jenkins suggests, represents the ""return"" Mr Bin Laden accrues on his investments in disparate acts of terrorism. Increasingly the west attributes them to him, solidifying his legendary status in the angry refugee camps and impoverished slums of the Arab world. The myth was burnished further last week when the CIA director, George Tenet, called Mr Bin Laden the ""most immediate threat to America's national security"". By pressuring Sudan to expel Mr Bin Laden, the US has managed to raise his operating costs. Patrick Clawson, the research director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said: ""He is no longer in the heart of the Arab world. It is very different trying to operate out of Afghanistan where every movement in and out is going to be suspicious."" The point was underlined yesterday when it was announced that two Saudi men, a father and son, had been arrested by Pakistani police on the Afghan border carrying cash to Mr Bin Laden. However, it is thought that al-Qaeda is still able to move most of its funds around with the aid of the internet and state-of-the-art encryption devices. Just as modern, flexible business organisations can rapidly adapt to changing markets, so can al-Qaeda. The portrait being painted in court this month is a rapidly-fading snapshot of the past. The organisation has shown its ability to mutate a hundred times since then. To keep up, western counter-intelligence must rely on all the satellite surveillance tools at its disposal, together with the hope that one day, another underpaid al-Qaeda clerk will show up at the visa window of another US embassy.",2001-02-17T02:31:34Z,"{'polarity': 0.11405724778366287, 'subjectivity': 0.42342630639800455}",0.42342630639800455
world/2001/jun/05/israel,Arafat's fragile ceasefire,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/05/israel,"The field commanders of the Palestinian uprising began urging their men yesterday to honour the ceasefire declared by Yasser Arafat to stave off a devastating Israeli attack. As the order to hold fire was transmitted through the ranks of Mr Arafat's Fatah militias, a gunbattle raged in the southern Gaza Strip, demonstrating the fragility of the truce, which has only the grudging support of the armed groups, even those loyal to Mr Arafat. Mr Arafat declared the ceasefire two days ago, bowing to intense international pressure in the wake of the horrific suicide attack on a Tel Aviv disco. Although his commanders gave it their support yesterday, their efforts to implement it could easily be undone if Israel does not relax the intensified siege of the West Bank or Gaza, or by trigger-happy armed men on either side. Twenty Palestinians were injured by Israeli rockets and gunfire in the Rafah refugee camp on the border with Egypt. There were conflicting reports of who shot first when Israeli soldiers began fortifying the concrete barricades along the frontier. Two soldiers were wounded. Otherwise there was a huge reduction in the number of attacks, demonstrating the widespread shock in Palestinian circles at the scale of the carnage caused by the suicide bombing of the seafront disco which killed 20 people, mainly teenage girls. The attack was claimed by the armed wing of the Islamic militant group Hamas. But the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, holds Mr Arafat responsible for car and suicide attacks within Israel's borders, claimed by Islamic militants freed from his jails. The threat of harsh Israeli reprisals led Mr Arafat to issue his first public call for a ceasefire since the start of the uprising eight months ago. It may also give him some badly needed influence over the Hamas and Islamic Jihad bombers who are not under his direct control. Yesterday a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Abdel Aziz Rantisi, said the organisation would back the truce. ""Hamas will never ever clash with our brothers in the Palestinian Authority. Hamas will be the guards of the Palestinian national unity because we are facing the same enemy."" But the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which carried out a car bomb attack in Jerusalem last month and is responsible for mortar attacks on Jewish settlements in Gaza, rejected the ceasefire. In the West Bank, Kamal Hmeid, head of the Fatah forces in Bethlehem district, met the gunmen who have been firing on the road linking Jerusalem to a southern Jewish settlement block and the illegal settlement of Gilo, on the border of the city. ""It is very clear for us from the moment Mr Arafat took the decision: there will not be any firing from any place in Bethlehem,"" Mr Hmeid said. ""As we understand it, this decision is for a long time. It is forever - unless the Israeli side starts to do something."" The gunmen argued, but eventually agreed that the ceasefire would hold. Similar efforts were under way throughout the West Bank. ""We are honouring the chairman's decision for a ceasefire,"" said Hussein Sheikh, who commands the biggest West Bank militia, in Ramallah. ""We are giving a possibility of ending this war that the government of Israel has opened against the Palestinian people."" But support for the truce in the ranks of Fatah remains reluctant at best. They say it amounts to an abject surrender unless Israel responds by lifting the extreme closure imposed on the West Bank and Gaza at the weekend, or by agreeing to a freeze on Jewish settlements: a key condition of the blueprint for an agreement drawn up by the former US senator George Mitchell. ""For us, the question is what is the use of a ceasefire, and what is the return?"" said Majid Maraka, a prominent Fatah leader in the Hebron area. ""There are no political concessions from the other side, and in the meantime Israel continues its aggression against us."" Fatah leaders insist that the ceasefire does not mean the end of the intifada. It does not apply to stone-throwing protests, and they do not rule out military action if the Israeli army invades areas under the control of Mr Arafat's administration. Most significantly, they rule out the re-arrest of Islamic militants: one of three ceasefire conditions set by Mr Sharon if he is to stay Israel's hand. Deal in the balance: the key factions Israel accuses Yasser Arafat of presiding over a ""coalition of terror"" in areas of the West Bank and Gaza under his control. Here are some of the organisations who will decide the fate of the ceasefire declared by the Palestinian leader on Saturday. The Palestinian Authority There are about 35,000 armed men in several different security organisations under the control of Mr Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Israel has accused his elite security corps, Force 17; the intelligence chief, Tawfiq Tirawai; and the chief of preventative security in Gaza, Mohammed Dahlan, of being directly involved in organising attacks on Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers. The Palestinians strenuously deny these charges. Fatah The leading faction in the PLO, the Fatah movement is Mr Arafat's support base, and it has tens of thousands of members. Armed militias of Fatah have played the lead role in the uprising, and are mainly responsible for the drive-by attacks on Jewish settlers in the West Bank. However, they oppose attacks inside the Jewish state. The Fatah militias in West Bank towns operate independently, and are in turn made up of small cells of gunmen. Regional leaders say they view Mr Arafat's ceasefire as a direct order, and they will act to bring their men into line. However, there are grumbles among the rank-and-file who say Fatah's support for the peace process before the eruption of the intifada drained it of support. Many drifted away to militant organisations such as Hamas. Hamas The Islamist militant group rejects the notion of a negotiated peace with Israel, unlike Fatah, and is fighting for a Palestinian state, in essence the destruction of the Jewish state. The military wing of Hamas was reborn when Mr Arafat opened his jails last October, releasing hundreds of activists. Although the organisation initially was wary of supporting the intifada, it has slowly come to the forefront. It has claimed eight suicide attacks inside Israel, including the bombing of a Tel Aviv disco last Friday night. Israeli intelligence officials believe the armed wing has 300 active members. Hamas political leaders say they will support the ceasefire. Islamic Jihad Smaller than Hamas, but a decade older, Islamic Jihad emerged in the Gaza Strip during the 1970s, and is linked to Iran. Unlike Hamas, it is an exclusively military group, but it shares Hamas's opposition to the existence of Israel, and has carried out car bombs and suicide attacks inside the borders of the Jewish state. Palestinian officials say the group has pledged to respect Mr Arafat's ceasefire, but there has been no direct statement from the group. Other groups The intifada has seen the emergence of a number of armed organisations. Some are believed to be led by individual gunmen, members of Fatah. Others are rogue groups. In addition, last month saw the re-emergence of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine which yesterday said it would not back the ceasefire. The allegiance of other groups is uncertain.",2001-06-05T01:19:38Z,"{'polarity': 0.008890625, 'subjectivity': 0.39503125}",0.39503125
world/2001/feb/19/usa.iraq2,Raid shows Bush-Blair bond on Iraq,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/19/usa.iraq2,"Friday night's air strikes on targets near Baghdad were cleared by Tony Blair and George Bush after requests from military commanders increasingly worried by the threat to their aircraft posed by new Iraqi radar and missile systems, defence sources said yesterday. The RAF and the US air force were concerned at what they saw as heightened risks for their pilots. Whether there is a legal basis for the no-fly zones from which the US and Britain have barred Iraqi planes since the Gulf war ended in 1991 was not an issue for them, but is a matter of controversy for the politicians. British ministers argue that the zones are being maintained for humanitarian reasons - to reduce the ability of the Iraqi regime to attack its opponents among the Shia in the south and the Kurds in the north. The air forces sought political clearance to act after registering serious threats from Iraq's new integrated air defence system, coordinated by fibre optic communications and bolstered by a growing number of SA-6 surface-to-air missiles supplied - according to intelligence sources - by Serbia and Ukraine. British Tornado jets cannot fly as high as US F-15 aircraft, nor are their defence systems as good. That no Tornado had been shot down, British defence sources said yesterday, was a combination of ""skill and luck"". Requests to change the rules of engagement to allow British and US aircraft to bomb military targets whether or not they were inside the no-fly zone were made early this year by British and American commanders frustrated at restrictions imposed by the Clinton administration. The military's argument is that Iraqi installations exercising command and control for the zones can be located beyond the zone boundaries which were set by Britain and the US at the suggestion of the former prime minister John Major. President Bush is believed to have discussed these requests at a special White House meeting on Iraq earlier this month. They were almost certainly discussed at a meeting two weeks ago in Munich between Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, and Geoff Hoon, his British counterpart, and taken up by Robin Cook in Washington last week. But defence sources insist that the timing of the raids was a military decision. Eight RAF aircraft were involved and were given just one target, in the southern no-fly zone. The RAF is not equipped with US ""stand-off"" weapons which enable pilots to fire their weapons farther from the target. British Paveway laser-targeted bombs were used in Friday night's attack, which involved four Tornado bombers, two Tornado defence support aircraft, and two VC-10 tankers. British defence sources expressed surprise at the response to the raids, suggesting that it had been hyped up by the media with shots of the Baghdad skyline lit up by anti-aircraft fire. Their reaction perhaps can be explained by the fact that this is generally a ""forgotten war"", though British aircraft have dropped well over 100 bombs on ground installations where Iraqi targeting equipment has locked on to the western patrol aircraft. The 10-year US-British operation has cost taxpayers more than £900m. Contrary to claims yesterday by the government - including Brian Wilson, the new Foreign Office minister responsible for Iraq - the no-fly zones are not sanctioned by any UN security council resolution. The British and US governments justify them by referring to security council resolution 688 of April 1991, which condemned ""the repression of the Iraqi civilian population in many parts of Iraq [and] demands that Iraq ... immediately end this repression"". Few now believe the patrols serve any purpose in the south, the reason France gave in 1998 for stopping its air patrols. Mr Hoon said at the weekend that in international law Britain was ""perfectly entitled to deter aggression"". The Commons foreign affairs committee said last year that ""at the very least, the doctrine of humanitarian intervention has a tenuous basis in current customary law"", while the defence committee said: ""The precise legal basis for the no-fly zones is controversial."" Mr Cook said yesterday that President Saddam had not given up his claim to Kuwait or wish to get weapons of mass destruction. But the no-fly zones were not imposed to deter these threats. Turkey, from where US and British aircraft patrol the northern zone but which also conducts attacks on Kurds, was one of many countries to criticise the latest raids.

world/2001/may/07/zimbabwe.chrismcgreal,Zimbabwe awaits verdict on its future,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/07/zimbabwe.chrismcgreal,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, goes on trial today on politically motivated charges of treason designed to prevent him from running for president against Robert Mugabe. The legal assault on the increasingly cowed opposition comes as the government unleashes a fresh wave of intimidation against its detractors, this time aimed at breaking Mr Tsvangirai's support in the cities after Mr Mugabe's ""war veterans"" successfully terrorised the rural areas. Armed thugs are targeting businesses in an attempt to curb financial backing for the opposition and intimidate workers into supporting Mr Mugabe. But the prosecution of Mr Tsvangirai is a key component of the government's strategy to ensure that Mr Mugabe faces no real challenge in an election that should be held within a year. If the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader is sentenced to more than six months in prison, he will be constitutionally barred from running for president. ""The charges against me are politically motivated to get me out of the way before the presidential elections next year,"" Mr Tsvangirai told the Guardian. ""The charges go hand in hand with the campaign of terror being perpetrated by Mugabe's war veterans. For two weeks factories have been invaded by war veterans but the police have done nothing. Innocent people have been beaten and killed. Judges have been threatened."" At the time of Mr Tsvangirai's arrest, the information minister, Jonathan Moyo, accused the opposition of terrorism. ""It has now become clear that the MDC is the Movement for Violent Change that is interested in bomb and grenade issues,"" he said. ""It is our duty as government to prosecute any crime that is committed. It is our responsibility to uphold the rule of law. No one is exempt from the law."" The fact that Mr Mugabe's more violent supporters are exempt from the law - and are literally allowed to get away with murder in some cases - is a clear indication of the political menace behind the charges. But whatever the motive for the prosecution, Mr Tsvangirai probably has a case to answer, albeit under oppressive colonial-era security laws that Ian Smith's white regime used to hold Mr Mugabe for 10 years without trial. The MDC leader is being tried for terrorism for a remark he made at an opposition rally in September when the party was still buoyant after it came tantalisingly close to winning parliamentary elections three months earlier. Mr Tsvangirai warned the government that its days were numbered. ""We say to Robert Mugabe, if you don't want to go peacefully, we will remove you violently,"" he said. A few hours later he called a press conference to ""clarify"" that he was not threat ening a rebellion against the president but merely warning that people would rise up if he clung to power. The prosecution is certain to focus on who Mr Tsvangirai meant by ""we"". Immediately before his remark he had been talking about the MDC. It may be a sign of the government's confidence that it has allowed a widely respected and independent judge to hear the case. Moses Chinhengo ruled twice against the government last year over the issues of farm invasions and press freedom. If he is convicted, Mr Tsvangirai will have to hope for a sentence of less than six months to avoid the constitutional bar on running for president. The charges carry a maximum of life in prison. There is another scenario that is almost as bad for the opposition; that Mr Tsvangirai will receive a lesser sentence but Mr Mugabe will call a snap election while he is still in prison. The MDC leader's lawyers say their opening ploy today will be to try to get the case moved from the high court to the supreme court on the grounds that the Law and Order (Maintenance) Act is unconstitutional. Mr Tsvangirai is charged under section 51, which covers ""terrorism and sabotage"". The supreme court remains independent despite Mr Mugabe's efforts to purge ""disloyal"" judges, white and black. Zimbabwe's chief justice, Anthony Gubbay, was forced to take early retirement in March after war veterans threatened to kill him. But he won an assurance from the government that it would not embark on an immediate purge of other judges. That has left the four other members of the supreme court in place, all of whom have demonstrated their independence. Zimbabwe's highest court may prove Mr Tsvangirai's best hope. ""The judiciary is not succumbing to intimidation,"" he said. ""Judges have been threatened but they are standing up to Mugabe. I am convinced the court will deliver a fair verdict."" The same act is being used to charge the MDC's vice-president, Gibson Sibanda, and two other party officials for allegedly inflammatory speeches, and to detain four of Mr Tsvangirai's bodyguards who have been accused of undergoing military training in Uganda. Whatever the outcome of the trial, the violence against the MDC is likely to escalate as the election draws nearer. In recent weeks, the war veterans have rampaged through scores of businesses in Harare, beating factory managers and taking them to the offices of the ruling Zanu-PF party to extort large amounts of money in ""compensation"" for dismissed workers. The British manager of the Avenues clinic, the country's largest private hospital, went into hiding on Friday after war veterans threatened him. Armed men also descended on the Spring Steel factory until its 130 workers drove them out. ""Anybody in industry who does not pay money to the war veterans is in for trouble. Police give no protection,"" said its owner, Marco Garizio. The government has also written to foreign embassies threatening the safety of diplomats it said were supporting the opposition. The degree to which the MDC has been outmanoeuvred, intimidated and cowed could be seen at the opposition leader's latest rally. The turnout was poor and almost everyone present left after war veterans marched into the stadium. Zimbabweans can perhaps draw some comfort from the isolated protest of the industry and trade minister, Nkosana Moyo, an independent, who resigned at the weekend over the attacks on businesses. But such is Mr Mugabe's reputation for vindictiveness that Mr Moyo sent his family to South Africa before quitting and then quickly joined them. For now, with the opposition leader on trial and the war veterans on the streets, many Zimbabweans are more despondent than ever at the prospect of unseating Mr Mugabe and Zanu-PF.",2001-05-07T01:04:15Z,"{'polarity': 0.029836734693877556, 'subjectivity': 0.3630714285714285}",0.3630714285714285
world/2001/jan/11/chechnya.iantraynor,US aid worker seized as chaos rules in long fight for Chechnya,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/11/chechnya.iantraynor,"An American charity worker has been kidnapped in Chechnya in a daylight ambush - apparently by Chechen rebels - that gives the lie to claims by Russia that it controls the battered republic. Kenneth Gluck, 38, who heads the mission of the Dutch branch of Médecins Sans Frontières in the Chechnya region, was abducted by masked gunmen while travelling out of the village of Starye Atagi south of the Chechen capital, Grozny, on Tuesday, MSF announced yesterday. A fellow American, Jonathan Little, who heads the Moscow office of the Paris-based Action Contre la Faim charity, evaded capture and was believed to be nursing slight wounds. Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in Chechnya in recent years, causing the major charities and aid organisations to pull out international staff. Only over the past 15 months have the charities hesitantly started to return. The kidnapping came amid increasing evidence of disarray in the Russian campaign to tame the Chechen rebels, 15 months into what has become a savage war of attrition. Two Russian local government chiefs in northern Chechnya have just resigned in disgust at the policy of the Kremlin and the Russian military, complaining that Russian tactics are inflicting a ""war without end"" on Chechnya. Sergei Ponomarenko, one of the two who resigned, told the newspaper Izvestia yesterday that the Russian or loyalist Chechen administrators are using their positions to line their pockets. He also said that the rebels are able to move freely, distribute their propaganda across Chechnya with impunity, and have seized the initiative from the Russians. President Vladimir Putin said last week that his priority in Chechnya was ""social rehabilitation and economic recovery"". But a senior Kremlin aide told Mr Ponomarenko that ""there is no programme yet for restoring the republic, so there's no point putting any money in"". The guerrillas are killing Russian troops, police, and ""collaborationist"" members of the pro-Moscow Chechen administration on a daily basis, as well as its local supporters. A village Muslim religious leader was shot dead while praying on Tuesday. Two relatives of another imam murdered last summer were also killed. Three Russian policemen died in a booby-trap bomb blast. An aide to Akhmad Kadyrov, the pro-Moscow Chechen leader, was wounded. Seven Russian soldiers were injured by a mine in Grozny. Such is the daily litany of casualties from a war that the Russians long ago claimed to have won. In October Moscow said that 2,472 Russian servicemen had died in Chechnya. The defence ministry and the office of the Chechnya war spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, yesterday refused to provide an updated tally. In a recent detailed report to the Russian government after a visit to Chechnya, Ruslan Khasbulatov, a former Russian parliamentary leader and himself a Chechen, complained that the Russian forces were systematically looting Chechnya and deliberately prolonging the war to sabotage any political settlement. ""This has turned into a war against an entire civilian population. That's a fact."" Mr Khasbulatov called for a ""radical shift"" in Kremlin policy towards Chechnya, while liberal Russian MPs have been exploring peace talks with the Chechen separatist leader, President Aslan Maskhadov. But Mr Putin last week condemned Mr Maskhadov as illegitimate, offered no hint of a political settlement, and insisted Russia ""has to bring the process to its logical end from the military point of view"". Tuesday's kidnapping occurred as Mr Gluck was leaving Starye Atagi in a convoy of four vehicles. Masked gunmen opened fire on the convoy. ""They were stopped. Kenny was singled out and taken away,"" said Wouter Kok, an MSF colleague in Amsterdam who yesterday was organising contacts to secure Mr Gluck's release. The Russian authorities instantly declared that Mr Gluck deserved his fate since the aid workers were travelling without permission and without a Russian military escort. ""Part of the blame for this tragedy lies with the international organisation,"" said Lieutenant-General Ivan Babichev, the Russian military commander in Chechnya. ""Such conduct by foreign citizens and international aid workers in Chechnya is dangerous. Unfortunately that's been proven in the case of Kenny."" But Jim Lewis of MSF in Moscow said Mr Gluck had all the required paperwork from the Russian authorities, adding: ""The Russians are issuing misinformation.""",2001-01-11T02:37:43Z,"{'polarity': -0.013636363636363636, 'subjectivity': 0.2021464646464646}",0.2021464646464646
world/2001/feb/18/books.booksnews,Football confronts its Nazi past,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/18/books.booksnews,"They are some of the most famous names in world football. But now clubs such as Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund look set to achieve a new notoriety as a spotlight is cast over their relationship with Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party. The German football federation, which for years has attempted to whitewash its close relationship with the Nazis, has finally bowed to intense pressure to open its archives to historians. German historians have already begun to chronicle the darkest chapter in the sport's history that began when it was 'taken over' by the Nazi Party in 1933. Jewish players and Jewish club chiefs were first sidelined and excluded from international games, and then later unceremoniously kicked out, a process that began in the early 30s. More than 300 Jewish players disappeared during the Nazi era: some died in suspicious circumstances and several others perished later in concentration camps. There has been little attempt to find out what happened to them. Hitler hated football but quickly learnt how useful it would be to exploit a sport that had become popular in the 1920s as a means of propaganda to promote the aggressive German style. He also realised the political potential in the mass gatherings of football fans. 'Winning a match,' Goebbels wrote, 'is of more importance to the people than the capture of a town in the east.' Football practice was turned into paramilitary training, and footballers were forced to give the Nazi salute as well as undergoing regular 'Nazi tests', where they were questioned on such facts as Hitler's birthday. Even the English team was forced to give the Nazi salute as a sign of respect for Germany during one match between the two countries. But plans by Goebbels to 'force victories' were unachievable. Defeat after embarrassing defeat led to Goebbels banning all international games. Until now, German football authorities have been reluctant to reveal details of the game's history. The federation (DFB) claims that it has been able to help on the subject because most of its documents were destroyed by the Allies. 'At the moment there is very little material in our archives,' said DFB general secretary Horst R. Schmidt in a recent statement. 'This is because the entire property of the headquarters when it was in Berlin fell victim to an air raid, which burnt the building down.' But historians specialising in the period hotly refute this version of events, saying that historical documents from various sources prove that the parts of the building on Berlin's so-called Reichs Sport field, where the DFB had its headquarters, were not touched by the bomb. Insiders have instead spoken of huge stacks of archive material being 'spirited away' over the years in an attempt to keep the truth hidden. Germany is to host the World Cup in 2006 and, say commentators, is keen to 'clear up' this unhappy chapter in its history before it receives too much adverse publicity from abroad. The DFB issued a directive to all its clubs six weeks ago, calling on them to 'work through and come to terms with' their Nazi pasts, and produce documentation with which histo rians could work. Close attention will be paid to the way in which FC Bayern Munich deals with its past. It recently refused to pay into a compensation fund for former Nazi slave labourers to which Ger man firms and commercial institutions have been asked to contribute, saying that it was itself a victim of the Nazis. Many critics said it had gravely missed the point of the fund. Before 1933 the club offered refuge to Munich's Jews, earning itself the nickname 'Jews Club'. FC Bayern's rise to the top of the league in the Twenties and Thirties was largely due to its Jewish president Kurt Landauer, who later had to flee Germany and was replaced with an Aryan chief. Borussia Dortmund was the first top-league club to respond to the DFB's demands for critical reappraisal, commissioning its archivist to fulfil the task. The make-up of Borussia Dortmund before the war was typical of others from the Rhineland, full of players and supporters from the socialist and communist milieu. Pressure from the Nazis forced it in 1933 to change its left-leaning club chief, Egon Pentrup, with August Busse, a member of the Nazi Party. Like most clubs, Borussia has over the years claimed that its members were split over Nazi ideology. But already in 1939, 80 per cent of the first team were members of Hitler's Stormtroopers. Berlin's Schalke 04 club, which was national champion six times between 1933 and 1945, was also successfully turned into a Nazi team. Some people fear that Germany's football history may come full circle. Much attention has been paid in recent years to the Berlin football club Dynamo, the former club of East Germany's Stasi police, which now has a reputation for being the club of Germany's rightwing skinheads.

world/2001/may/21/israel1,Gaza strip,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/21/israel1,"The daily misery of life for Palestinians in the world's most densely populated piece of real estate is encapsulated in a twin set of traffic lights in the middle of Gaza. When the light is green, the mile-long line of Palestinian cars inches another yard or so past the machine guns jutting out of the army pillbox on to a road denuded of its palm trees, and squeezed to half its width by giant concrete slabs. When the light turns red - as it does when a single car travels between the illegal Jewish settlements that straddle the junction - life comes to a halt. The light turned red soon after 10am yesterday morning when a Jewish settler, Anita Tucker, set out in her white Citroën with a trailer of fresh celery from her greenhouses in the Gush Katif settlement block, to deposit the load at the Kfar Darom outpost. She left behind a long queue of Palestinian vehicles - and Israeli tanks, military jeeps and barbed wire guarding the two settlements, which straddle the main road linking the southern Palestinian towns of Rafah and Khan Yunis to the territory's capital in Gaza City. As the collective waiting time of Palestinians stranded at this army checkpoint2 stretches into thousands of hours, an entire landscape is being transformed beyond recognition. Since the start of the uprising eight months ago, some 11,000 dunams (one dunam is 1,000 square metres) of Palestinian-owned farmland have been razed by Israel's bulldozers, as have at least 94 homes, several posts of the Palestinian police, and last week, a £700,000 yoghurt factory and two wells. The destruction is gathering momentum, with evidence that the Israeli army is carrying out systematic incursions into lands controlled by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority to bulldoze homes and greenhouses, and rip out citrus groves and farmland with the aim of creating a security cordon hundreds of metres deep around the borders of the 140-square mile territory. ""It is very logical, they are trying to clear all the border areas,"" Raji Sourani, director of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights in Gaza City, said. ""Most of the houses on the border have been destroyed. Anyone who goes there, they shoot at him - civilian or soldier. Their tanks hide in the sand dunes and shoot at everyone."" The destruction started late last year around the roads leading to Kfar Darom and the other Jewish settlements. It has gathered momentum since April 17, when Israeli tanks rolled up to the edges of Beit Hanoun, on the northern edges of the territory, and occupied a square mile of land for several hours. A rare and sharply worded rebuke from Washington forced Israel's hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon, to pull back his tanks. But since then the Israeli army has briefly invaded territory under the control of the Pales tinian Authority dozens of times2, Mr Sourani said. A spokesman for the Israeli army said yesterday: ""We don't keep count."" He added: ""It depends on the situation, and the operation."" Last week, the Israeli army signalled that it had a free hand to initiate incursions into territory that was awarded to Mr Arafat's control in peace accords seven years ago. Previously, it had described such raids as reprisals for shooting and mortar attacks by Palestinian militias on Gaza's illegal Jewish settlement blocks. For Ms Tucker, who is eager to show visitors the dimple left by one mortar bomb on the lush lawns of the youth centre in her settlement of Netzer Hazani, the tough stance was overdue. But evidence gathered during a tour of Gaza's border areas support allegations that the territory's northern, eastern and southern perimeters are being transformed into free-fire zones. The bulldozers arrived at lunchtime last week in the Salame neighbourhood of the southern town of Rafah, which has been a special target for the incursions, accompanied by a tank. ""Suddenly, a tank came right up to our houses,"" said Amna al-Sha'ir, whose clan owns several homes in the hard scrabble border area. ""We were so scared. The children ran out of the house barefoot."" The extended family of 10 huddled in a shed at the rear of their house as the bulldozers tore down the greenhouse where they had been growing tomatoes, and the home of a cousin that had taken 10 years' savings to build. ""I kept thinking I was going to die - me and the kids,"" Ms al-Sha'ir said. Some 46 buildings have been destroyed in the Rafah area since the abortive reoccupation of Khan Yunis. The Israeli army insists that the homes and shops were used as havens for the militias firing mortar bombs on Jewish settle2ments, and kibbutzim inside Israel's borders. The Sha'ir family flatly deny this. Such destruction has not been lost on the Jewish settlers of the Gaza Strip, whom the Israeli army claims to be protecting with its widespread demolition. Late last year, bulldozers demolished Palestinian homes on the southern fringes of Kfar Darom. Ten mobile homes, built for new arrivals to the illegal settlement, now stand in their stead. ""Of course, people living here felt terrible because they were friends with these people,"" Ms Tucker said. ""But it was not our fault this happened to them. Th2e people living there just let the Palestinian Authority take over and shoot non-stop. Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority did this to them."" Ms Tucker's home at the northern end of the Gush Katif block lies on the other side of the junction from Kfar Darom. For an outsider, it is difficult to fathom the attachment Gaza's 6,500 Jewish settlers claim to this tract of unlovable land, an expanse of dunes and scrub surrounded by hostile neighbours. But it is home, insists Ms Tucker, who was born in London and raised in New York, and was a founding member of Gush Katif 25 years ago. Here her family, like many of the settlers, have been raising greenhouse crops for the ultra-Orthodox, and organic produce: cherry tomatoes and cucumbers bound for European markets - including Marks &amp; Spencer. Despite the uprising, Ms Tucker continues to employ four Palestinian workers from Khan Yunis. Her workers take home an average wage of 40 shekels a day (£7) - about a third of the cost of the workers she has had to import from Thailand. In her view, maintaining order in her green houses is not unlike peacemaking. ""I know from all my years of working with the Arab workers that if you are nice to them, they walk all over you,"" she said. ""If I give a worker a pack of cigarettes, they stop working and will not do anything. But I am just tough and pay them - that's all - then I get good work out of them."" In the same vein, she dates the start of the Jewish settlers' troubles with the Palestinians to 1993 - when Mr Arafat signed a peace agreement with Israel. Ms Tucker is aware that most of the world sees her 2settlement as illegal and her presence in Gaza as an occupier, but she believes that is the only way of maintaining harmony between two peoples who claim the same piece of land. ""We lived with our neighbours very peacefully. It is true that they did not have the right to vote, but so long as we remained in charge here and got on with our neighbours, eventually we would have sorted something out."" But that would not have involved evacuating any of the Jewish settlements. ""It is crazy to have all the Arabs living here in Gaza when you know tomorrow they are not going to be your best friend.""",2001-05-21T00:00:43Z,"{'polarity': 0.006193974375792563, 'subjectivity': 0.33692043085982465}",0.33692043085982465
world/2001/may/18/usa.michaelellison,American mayor fights poll - and murder charge,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/18/usa.michaelellison,"Charlie Robertson was his usual bluff, genial self, the small-town mayor milking the chants of ""four more years"" on the occasion of his latest electoral endorsement. But 16 hours later it was another Charlie Robertson who presented himself to the community: this time he was resisting tears on the steps of city hall, his speech faltering in acknowledgement that the events of 32 years ago had caught up with him. ""Murder is the charge,"" he said. Mr Robertson, two-term mayor of York, Pennsylvania, says he is a reformed racist who saw the error of his ways long ago; the district attorney's office says he is a killer. The former sports coach surrendered yesterday to the police force he once served, accused of supplying the bullets that killed a black 27-year-old mother of two in a race riot. ""A lot of prayers are with me and I'm still the mayor,"" said the 67-year-old bachelor. ""I'm standing here in disbelief as to the charge, which they must prove, and to this I maintain my innocence."" Mr Robertson concedes that he was a racist police officer in the summer of 1969 when two people died during 10 days of rioting in the town, which has a population of 41,000 people, 40% of them minorities. He admits shouting ""white power"" at a rally the night before Lillie Belle Allen was shot dead but denies being the unnamed policeman who, according to court papers, supplied ammunition to at least one member of the street gang who fired at her car and urged raids on black neighbourhoods. The identity of the anonymous officer split black and white voters during Mr Robertson's campaign for the Democratic party's nomination to run again as mayor. But yesterday an affidavit from one of five other men accused of murder purported to lift the mask. Rick Lynn Knouse said Mr Robertson had given him bullets for his hunting rifle and said: ""Kill as many niggers as you can."" The mayor took the fifth amendment against self-incrimination during a recent hearing by a grand jury investigating the case and that of a white police officer three days earlier. Ms Allen's death, after she drove into a white neighbourhood in the town 85 miles west of Philadelphia, was largely overlooked until interest was revived by its 30th anniversary. A new generation of law enforcement officers is credited with a greater willingness to address racially inspired crimes of the past: their most recent success was the conviction this month of a 62-year-old former Ku Klux Klansman for the church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed four black girls in 1963. One year after the York riots, during which more than 100 people were arrested and 60 wounded, a judge accused Mr Robertson of ""outrageous and reprehensible"" behaviour at the white power rally. He was, though, also applauded for attempting to placate an angry crowd early in the clashes by calling out: ""It's me, Charlie."" The mayor says his racism dated back to 1949 when his father was mugged by three black men and that sensitivity training after the riots had changed his outlook. ""I tried so hard when I was a police officer not to let that interfere,"" he said of his 28 years on the force. Riots Mr Robertson has just been chosen by the Democratic party to run again for mayor. He defeated Ray Crenshaw, the first black to seek the office. An exit poll shows that 93% of Mr Robertson's support came from whites and that, for 74% of all voters, his part in the riots of 32 years ago was important in their decision. Indeed, one Robertson supporter in four said the summer of 1969 had influenced his or her vote. ""Where do you go with that?"" asked David Polk, who conducted the poll for the York Daily Record and a local television channel. Mr Crenshaw received 33% of his support from white voters. ""Black residents certainly are affected by what happened in the 60s and feel they cannot support Robertson because of that,"" said Mr Polk. ""What they're saying is if you're black and your mayor was out there shouting 'white power' it's going to affect you."" More than half of those in the poll said the mayor should resign if he was charged but he insists he will hang on. ""Absolutely. I will be the mayor until the day I leave office. I will not relinquish the mayor's office at all."" But Tom Wolf, his campaign manager, said: ""An arrest certainly isn't helpful in pushing the mayor's campaign forward."" Leo Cooper, York president of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, said the voters had passed up on the chance to vanquish systematic racism of a more sophisticated hue than that in the 50s and 60s. ""York is in a time warp that a lot of people don't want to get out of,"" he said. ""I'm disappointed to the point that I can't express myself. ""I think particularly the black community had an opportunity to step up out of the bowels of the 50s and 60s and take its rightful place in this community but it failed."" Mr Robertson said during the campaign: ""It's politics, a few people are trying to destroy my administration. This city has changed; it's grown up. I've got my own minorities working at city hall. ""My own neighbourhood is integrated and I love it."" He told the town: ""Forget about the riots. You're not voting on the riots."" How the past caught up with racist killers Maryvonne Grellier • Thomas E Blanton Jr, 62, a former Ku Klux Klansman, was convicted on May 1 of blowing up a church in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963 and killing four black girls inside. • Byron De La Beckwith was jailed in February 1994 for the 1963 murder of a black activist, Medgar Evers, in Mississippi. He was first tried on the same charges in 1964 but two separate juries failed to convict him. He died in prison last January. • Sam Bowers, 73, a former imperial wizard of the Klan, was found guilty in August 1998 of killing Vernon Dahmer, a civil rights leader in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, in 1966. • James Caston, Charles Caston and Harold Crimm, were all convicted in November 1999 of the 1970 manslaughter of Rainey Pool, a one-armed sharecropper, whom they savagely beat and threw off a bridge into a river. • In 1999, a local prosecutor in Washington parish, Louisiana, reopened a case involving the 1965 shooting ambush of the first black deputy sheriffs there, Oneal Moore and Creed Rogers. Moore was killed and Rogers wounded by shotgun blasts from a passing truck. The investigation continues. • In Natchez, Mississippi, authorities are reviewing the 1967 murder of Wharlest Jackson, a 36-year-old father of six and NAACP officer who died when a bomb exploded in his truck. • Jackson, Mississippi, reopened the 1966 murder of Ben Chester White, a black plantation caretaker, who was shot 16 times.

world/2001/mar/20/china.johngittings,Manhunt for mass killer fails to pacify Chinese,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/20/china.johngittings,"China's biggest mass murder for decades has left many wondering if a lone killer should be blamed, or a gang spawned by a society where gangsterism and the anger of workers sacked by collapsing textile firms are breeding violence. The official toll stands at 108 dead in what can be called the mystery of the cotton mill explosions - a series of bomb blasts in the northern city of Shijiazhuang in the darkness before dawn last Friday. Yesterday, China's ministry of public security was reported to have doubled the reward for information leading to the arrest of a long-time resident of the city, Jin Ruchao, 40. He was already wanted on suspicion of murdering his girlfriend a fortnight ago. And he is alleged to have been at odds with relatives living in the residential buildings hit by the blasts - two of them dormitories for cotton mill workers. ""Jin has a rude and savage temperament and a strong spirit of revenge,"" the police were quoted as saying. ""He has served a 10-year sentence for rape and his wife divorced him because of his behaviour."" Ordinary Chinese have been badly shaken by the cotton mill explosions, in spite of minimum reporting and tight security around the scene. Internet chat-rooms are posting cries of despair that China is no longer a safe society. People are asking how one social misfit might have got the materials and engineered such massive explosions, all detonated within an hour. Officials in the city, which lies about 200 miles south of Beijing, agree that whoever set off the bombs probably had accomplices. One theory is an individual of Mr Jin's sort was used by criminals intent on heightening social disorder. Another is that the bombs were a protest by angry workers sacked from the run-down cotton mills. Local officials admit that discontent has spread in Shijiazhuang among workers laid off with few benefits from the sagging cotton industry. There is speculation that they may have turned to violence to ""slow down the [economic] reforms"". The cotton mills which formerly provided 60% of local jobs have collapsed. At least 50,000 workers have been on ""indefinite leave"" since the mid-1990s. Meanwhile, they have seen the rich getting richer. ""Corrupt officials are making a lot of money,"" said one official, ""and the people resent this"". Another theory is that local gangsters planted the bombs to thwart an anti-corruption drive by new officials appointed after the former mayor and a provincial deputy governor were accused of massive corruption. In September a wave of small bombs hit department stores and buses, injuring 28 people. Some believe this was a turf struggle between rival gangs. The Beijing government is on the defensive after a string of tragedies. The most recent bombing came only a day after Premier Zhu Rongji apologised for an explosion in a south Chinese school which killed at least 41, most of them children. ""When the disaster occurred,"" asked a sarcastic contributor to the popular sina.com website, ""where were our uncles in the police force, and our good colleagues in the safety bureaus? Shouldn't some people be losing their jobs?"" ""My heart is sore,"" wrote another contributor. ""Why is it always we ordinary people who suffer? There have been so many terrible disasters in the last two years: what is the explanation?"" After this blast on March 6 at Fanglin primary school in Jiangxi province, police concluded that a local man with mental problems had committed suicide in the school by setting off two bags of fireworks. Parents at the school insist that the children were forced to make fireworks and that classrooms were full of inflammable materials. Though the Jiangxi government still insists on its version, an investigation announced at the weekend tacitly concedes the parents' claim. In Shijiazhuang, the explosions on March 16 reduced a five-storey dormitory building for the No 3 Cotton Mill to rubble at about 4am. There were other blasts at blocks of flats for a second cotton mill, for a construction company and for a railway agency. The few pictures released showed buried people, dead and alive, being extricated by grim workers. The No 3 dormitory is a short walk from the headquarters of the Communist party in Shijiazhuang, provincial capital of the northern province of Hebei and a centre for the declining textile industry. Senior party officials hurried to the scenebut domestic and foreign journalists were prevented from reporting the disaster. Explosives are widely available in China and are sometimes used by individuals with grudges. Posters calling for Mr Jin's detention appeared within a day in the national media. He lived in one of the targeted buildings, his father and stepmother lived in a second, and his ex-wife and her parents in two others. Mr Jin was in dispute with his aunt over some property in the fourth building. He should not be hard to identify. His gaunt features are distinctive and he uses a pen and paper to communicate because he is deaf. But residents say he may vanish among the migrant workers who in parts of Hebei province outnumber residents. The Shijiazhuang disaster has heightened an uneasiness among ordinary Chinese who feel that society has become more dangerous as the rich-poor gap has widened. A student from Shijiazhuang warned that the ""black societies [triad gangs] are getting closer to us all the time."" ""In the end where can we be safe?"" asked one of the contributors to the website debate. ""Terrorist tactics have entered China,"" wrote another.

world/2001/apr/15/israel,'The night the tanks took my home',World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/15/israel,"You hear them coming before you see them. A ragged volley of shots, then a ragged running file of young men, automatic rifles held high, the name of God on a black bandanna around foreheads. They are Islamic Jihad, one of the most extreme groups fighting the 'intifada' (uprising or, literally, shaking off) in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Here in the city of Rafah - a grey sprawl of crumbling concrete tenements and squalid, potholed roads hard against Gaza's southernmost frontier - they are the nearest to heroes anyone has. None is older than 18. They scramble on to a makeshift stage, form a line and fire another fusillade into the air. Their shouted hopes for martyrdom in the struggle against their 'oppressors' crash out through the loudspeakers' static into the city's sabbath evening calm. The rally - to commemorate an Islamic Jihad fighter killed in Rafah by rockets fired from an Israeli helicopter gunship 10 days before - goes on until dark. Later two gun battles break out in the city between locals and the Israeli settlers who live on the choice coastal land to its west. Elsewhere in Gaza, an Israeli civilian is shot and injured, two bombs are defused, a mortar is fired into a Jewish settlement and seven Palestinians are hurt when Israeli troops open fire on stone-throwers. It has, all agree, been a quiet day. Since this intifada started seven months ago 469 people - including 386 Palestinians - have died. For once that total has not been added to. But, despite the occasional hiatus in the violence, few believe peace will come soon. In Gaza - where more than a million Palestinians are crammed into a stretch of parched land 30 miles long and five wide - they talk of a 'summer of blood'. Only 10 miles from Rafah, hard by the brilliant blue Mediterranean, 25 Palestinian families are living in tents. Last week their homes were bulldozed by the Israeli army. In the firefight that followed, two people were killed and dozens injured. For the first time the Israelis had launched a ground attack deep inside territory that, according to agreements signed in the ailing peace process, is under the authority of President Yasser Arafat's government. The demolition was the strongest signal yet from Ariel Sharon - the hawkish former general elected as Israeli Prime Minister in February - that he will not moderate the hardline stance that brought him to power. On election, he pledged to use language 'the Arabs would understand'. At 1am last Wednesday, the people of Khan Yunis found out what that meant. Noor Abu Lous, a pretty, bright-eyed, seven-year-old girl, stood among the rubble of her home and told The Observer how the helicopters had woken her. 'I heard them and stopped sleeping, and when the shooting started my mummy and daddy told me not to be scared, so I wasn't because they were looking after me and there is always shooting here,' she said. 'But then the tanks came and we had to run away, and then I was frightened and when we came back our house had gone.' The Israelis claimed Arafat's forces were using the houses as cover to fire on a settlement and army bunkers less than 500 metres away. 'Of course people were shooting. This is our land, our children,' said Majid Abdallah, 37. 'The Israelis have destroyed some houses, so now we will shoot from a new front line. Will they come and flatten that? Will they demolish the whole city?' The answer from Israeli hardliners would be 'yes'. Last week the leader of the ultra-religious Shas party, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, called for Arabs to be killed with missiles. After the demolition in Khan Yunis, Sharon said the Palestinians were responsible for the violence, and there could be no negotiations until they ended it. He could accept a Palestinian state on a maximum of 42 per cent of the West Bank, but would not withdraw from any settlements or make concessions on Jerusalem or other key biblical sites. No one, least of all Sharon, believes Arafat could accept such a deal. The Palestinian leader rejected far more generous terms from Sharon's predecessor, Ehud Barak, last summer. For Sharon, every day that Israel continues to exist and thrive - however threatened - is a small victory. And he knows that for Arafat time is running out. Ask the people of Khan Yunis about the intifada and they - like the Islamic Jihad zealots in Rafah - will swear their readiness to die. Ask them about their support for Arafat, and the response is different. 'He is far away from his people now,' said Abdallah Abu Ahmed, 45. 'He is now a high jet-setter, not with us here in the dirt.' Such sentiments are growing. The al-Aqsa intifada - named after the seventh-century mosque in Jerusalem that was the focus for the revolt - is reaching a critical point and manyquestion its direction and purpose. Partly this is due to the economic suffering the intifada has brought. A blockade imposed by the Israelis has caused massive unemployment, inflation and shortages. The Israelis are also withholding crucial tax receipts. As a result, Arafat's fledgling Palestinian Authority is in dire difficulties. 'The public sector and the authority itself is on the verge of collapse. The intifada has been like an earthquake shattering the whole economic structure,' said Arie Arnon, professor of economics at Ben Gurion University. One thing Arafat still shares with his people is a sense of betrayal. Though the Arab world has pledged financial support for the intifada, only a trickle has got through. Though they expect little, they also feel betrayed by the West. The new administration in Washington has made it clear it wants to stay out of the conflict. Noor Abu Lous, standing in the rubble in her pink plastic sandals, sings to music booming from a loudspeaker set up by Hamas, one of the most radical Palestinian groups. Her father translates the lyrics: 'We are alone, we are alone, we will fight on because we are alone.'

world/2001/jun/12/mcveigh.usa,The death of Timothy McVeigh,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/12/mcveigh.usa,"Timothy McVeigh was killed yesterday in exactly the way he had wanted - at the centre of attention, with a nation hanging on every gesture. His four-minute execution by lethal injection in Indiana, at the flat, green centre of the United States, was perhaps the most minutely scrutinised death in history. McVeigh died with his eyes open and without uttering a word as he lay strapped to the execution table surrounded by witnesses and watched by a camera mounted on the ceiling. As a lethal series of three chemicals passed through yel low and grey tubes into his right leg, he looked straight into the camera, and through it to his surviving victims watching from Oklahoma City, where he had bombed his way into history six years ago. Witnesses saw him take a couple of deep breaths and gradually lose colour until he was a pale yellow. In the minutes before he died, he appears to have done everything possible to demonstrate his control over events, from a curt nod to each of the media witnesses to the borrowed verses - laid out in McVeigh's own neat but childlike handwriting - that he handed to the prison warden before his death. The poem was, as he had said it would be, Invictus written by the British poet William Earnest Henley in 1875. It ends with the words: ""I am the master of my fate/I am the captain of my soul."" The manner of McVeigh's killing conspired with him to amplify his sense of grandeur. The execution was watched by 10 journalists, McVeigh's lawyers, government officials, 10 survivors and victims' relatives in Terre Haute and another 232 in Oklahoma City, linked by satellite feed. They had insisted on watching and the injection was held up for 10 minutes while engineers scrambled to fix a fault in the transmission. Outside, 100 opponents of the death penalty held a silent vigil, and a handful of its supporters jeered. It is safe to say that no one's mind was changed; another federal execution is due in Terre Haute next week. In Washington, President Bush said McVeigh's victims had been given ""not vengeance, but justice"" - but his unshakeable faith in capital punishment is about to meet its most outraged critics as he begins his first official visit to Europe today. The witnesses relayed a detailed picture of the event. By the time they arrived, McVeigh had already watched television news about himself for the last time, and had been strapped to the execution table, a black padded hospital- like piece of furniture, with its back raised at a 40-degree angle. ""He cooperated entirely during the time he was restrained in the execution holding cell to the time he walked into the execution room,"" Harley Lappin, the Terre Haute warden, said. ""He stepped up on to a small step and sat down on the table where he then positioned himself for us to apply the restraints."" Then the curtain shielding the execution chamber from the three witness rooms was opened, and McVeigh raised his head up as far as he could to nod at and make eye-contact with those who had come to watch. ""He seemed almost to be trying to take charge of the room and understand his circumstances, nodding at each one of us individually."" Then he gave a ""sort of cursory glance toward the government section. He lay there very still,"" one of the witnesses, Shepard Smith, of the Fox News Channel, said. ""He never said a word. His lips were very tight. He nodded his head a few times. He blinked a few times."" He was covered up to his shoulders with a white sheet, tightly bound ""almost like a mummy"" one of the witnesses said. Linda Cavanaugh, a television reporter from Oklahoma City said: ""The last time I saw Tim McVeigh was in the courtroom in Denver. He had changed markedly. He was paler, he was thinner, and he did not have the same look of arrogance that he had in the courtroom in Denver."" McVeigh's fellow inmates had reported that he had kept a vegetarian diet in order to appear more emaciated on the day of his death. But for his last meal on Sunday, he ate two pints of mint chocolate ice cream. Mr Lappin, the warden and Frank Anderson, a US marshal, spoke the only words during the execution. A few minutes after 7am (1pm BST), after the glitch with the Oklahoma City television link had been fixed, the warden told the convict: ""Inmate McVeigh, you may make your last statement,"" but there was only silence. Mr Lappin then turned to Mr Anderson and said: ""Marshal, we are ready. May we proceed?"" Mr Anderson then picked up a red phone in the execution chamber, an open line to the justice department's command centre, and asked permission to go ahead. He put down the receiver and told the warden: 'We may proceed with the execution.'"" At 7.10, the warden announced that the first chemical, sodium pentothal, had been administered, to send him to sleep, followed a minute later by pancuronium bromide, to paralyse his lungs, and then one minute after that, potassium chloride, to stop his heart - all fed through tubes from a ""chemical room"" next door. ""His eyes did roll back slightly. I also saw the gulping breath, where his cheeks bubbled up. And I saw that twice,"" Nolan Clay, of the Daily Oklahoman, said. Susan Carlson, a Chicago radio reporter said: ""His skin began to turn a very strange shade of yellow towards the end. And he remained extremely rigid."" At 7.14 the warden announced that McVeigh was dead and declared: ""This concludes the execution."" Outside the squat red-brick prison, the air quickly filled with competing interpretations of the death. McVeigh's lawyer, Robert Nigh, apologised to the relatives of his 168 victims that his client had never expressed remorse and said he did not fault them for trying to seek relief in his killing. ""But if killing Tim McVeigh does not bring peace or closure to them, I suggest to you that it is our fault,"" Mr Nigh said. ""We have told them that we would help them heal their wounds in this way. We have taken it upon ourselves to promise to extract vengeance for them. We have made killing a part of the healing process."" Of the survivors and victims' relatives who came to watch, some complained that the death had been too easy. But most expressed satisfaction. ""I'm elated,"" said Sue Ashford, a survivor. ""I didn't want him being paid for by taxpayers' money. That ice cream is the last food we're ever going to buy him."" Outside the penitentiary gates, as the sun began to rise, the execution was generating some free publicity for a couple of desperate media ventures. A man dressed in a wedding gown danced with glee as the news of McVeigh's death filtered out. He was there to publicise a private radio station in Illinois.

world/2001/may/13/edvulliamy.theobserver,Stay of execution for McVeigh prolongs the pain for relatives,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/13/edvulliamy.theobserver,"'They're selling postcards of the hanging', wrote Bob Dylan, famously. In Terre Haute, Indiana, not quite - but there were plenty of T-shirts. One bore a syringe and the slogan: 'McVeigh. May 16th 2001. Final Justice'. But they got the wrong date. After the eleventh hour, the FBI was forced to admit to the latest in a series of extraordinary blunders; forcing a delay until 11 June in the most public execution anywhere within living memory which, if it happens at all, will not follow the rising of the sun - as planned - on Wednesday. The FBI's bungle was to withhold 3,000 pages of documents from the trial of Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the worst act of mass murder in American history - the Oklahoma bomb of 19 April 1995 which killed 168 people, 19 of them children. The documents are so-called '302' papers pertaining to the elusive 'John Doe 2' - a supposed accomplice sought along with McVeigh and subject of thousands of reported sightings. For the FBI, this is a further descent into humiliation. First came the shooting by FBI snipers of Vicki Weaver, wife of a survivalist militiaman, during a stand-off in 1992. Then there was a fiery debacle in 1993 at the Waco headquarters of the Koresh cult, revenge for which McVeigh claims as lunatic justification. After that, embarrassment over Robert Jewel, non-bomber of the Atlanta Olympics in 1998; then the collapse of a bungled investigation at Los Alamos into scientist Wen Ho Lee. Most recently came the case of the Bureau's veteran counter-intelligence agent Robert Hanssen - a KGB spy. Only days before this latest, most serious, farce, the head of the FBI, Louis Freeh, offered President Bush his resignation. But the investigation into the 3,000 pages must go on. People familiar with the case said the FBI's sloppy data storage and retrieval system were likely to blame for the fiasco. The agency had been warned about the information management problem in 1999. An FBI official told the Washington Post that search directives had probably been misinterpreted. Even if they are no more than a technical blunder, the papers' re-entry into the case could be like a drop of ink on blotting paper, blurring the cut-and-dried conviction around McVeigh and casting doubt once again on whether he was operating alone. Or they could even, if McVeigh'slawyers have their way, open the door for an appeal. But McVeigh has enjoyed stewing in his lone wolf fantasy and dismissed any suggestion of accomplices to his crime, to which he readily admits. He even sacked one lawyer for believing in a wider conspiracy. But it is a defence attorney's job to keep a client alive even if he wants to die, and McVeigh's lawyers are now scouring the interviews omitted from trial papers to find the slightest chink. One, Christopher Tritico, said on Friday: 'I see this as leading to a possible re-opening of Tim's writ,' while lead attorney Robert Nigh was bunkered down with his client, trying to escort him back though the entrance to God's waiting room. Nigh said McVeigh would make an 'informed decision' on whether to appeal and might challenge the sentence. 'He is resilient. He's capable of evaluating new information and making a decision based on that information.' Oklahoma City and Terre Haute sit at either end of the vast expanse of prairie, wheat and corn that is mid-America - a prairie that connects the bombed heart of the Heartland to the low-slung federal penitentiary where the bomber was to die from an intravenous cocktail of sodium pentathol, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride. Oklahoma City and Terre Haute also sit at either end of six years between the worst carnage of recent US history and an execution billed as 'closure' for the bereaved. But this latest twist plays even harder on the already frayed nerves of survivors and relatives of the dead, now left even further behind by what has become the story not of their loss but of McVeigh's grotesque and ghoulish martyrdom - orchestrated by him, and indulged by the mass media. Indeed, it is hard (for those who covered the explosion - God forbid those who suffered it) to connect the combined tragic-farce of FBI blunders and (merely postponed) invasion of Terre Haute to that accursed night in Oklahoma when the stench of death and scorched masonry hung heavy in the heat. It was the night Kathleen Treanor wandered blank-faced through stunned crowds clutching a photograph of her four-year-old daughter Ashley, who had a smile like a Spring daisy and had gone to town that morning with Grandma and Grandpa, as a treat. 'They're missing,' she mumbled, 'all three', asking meekly if anyone had perchance seen the child. Ashley Treanor's little corpse was finally recovered from that rubble, as were those of her grandparents, Luther and LaRue Treanor,. And on Friday, the little peace Mrs Treanor regained was put back on the emotional rack. 'I just don't understand what's happened here. I didn't get much sleep last night. Everyone knew how important it was not to make any errors, now we're finding out that they did make errors - and we don't know what to do next Wednesday.' As darkness fell on Friday evening hundreds of Oklahoma citizens - including Mrs Treanor, who had planned to witness the execution on closed-circuit TV - gathered at the site of the bombing Some were angry, expressing outrage given McVeigh's admission of guilt. 'It's like a big old clamp squeezing my gut,' said Dan McKinney, whose wife was killed in the bombing. This was not to be a public hanging like the last one in US history - that in 1936 of rapist Rainey Bethea in Owensboro, Kentucky, when 'the crowds came in freight trains, hotels were full and ""hanging parties"" were in progress'. But almost. Within two hours of the announcement of McVeigh's execution date, every room in the Holiday Inn had been booked. By Tuesday some 1,600 journalists, television reporters and technicians were to have descended on Terre Haute. That excludes sightseers, ghouls and rival battalions of demonstrators. But whatever the outcome, a combination of FBI 'errors' and Terre Haute 'circus' suits Timothy McVeigh fine, compounding his phony mystery and lone wolf martyrdom - both now trumpeted with more hullabaloo than ever. McVeigh has gone to great lengths to tell the world he wants to die. It came as no surprise when he let the deadline for clemency appeals pass, saying he would not 'beg any man for my life'. The public became acquainted with McVeigh's 'normal' or 'better' side, as though these details somehow mitigated his crime: childhood, school, friendships, lost loves, army days, and how his favourite movie is Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, and his preferred cartoon is The Simpsons. But that 'lest you think I'm only a mindless cartoon addict, I will admit that I'm a Star Trek junkie too'. These nuggets are from letters written between 1996 and 1999 to Oklahoma reporter Phil Bacharach. The nadir came, say relatives of the dead, with the recent book American Ter rorist, written with McVeigh's co-operation, and published by Rupert Murdoch's Harper Collins. The volume famously quoted him calling dead children 'collateral damage' and ridiculing the bereaved as a 'woe-is-me crowd'. When the execution finally takes place, one man certainly will not be there: Mike Grumere, fire chief in Honey Creek where the prison technically lies. 'It's a sad testimonial to the American public,' he mused, 'that we have [nothing] better to do than send 1,500 media people to come watch this scumbag bite the big one. I think it's pathetic.'",2001-05-13T01:26:49Z,"{'polarity': 0.011812613714787628, 'subjectivity': 0.48412894472677076}",0.48412894472677076
world/2001/feb/19/iraq.comment,Comment: Saddam and Sharon - villains and heroes,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/19/iraq.comment,"Israel has just elected a prime minister who, brought before the bar of international justice, would surely be judged a war criminal in the class of, say, Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander as firmly associated with the Srebrenica massacre as General Sharon was with that of Sabra and Shatila during the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Sharon calls Yasser Arafat ""a murderer and a liar"" but, in the run-up to the elections, the liberal Israeli press copiously illustrated the deceit and sanguinary brutality which have been the twin pillars of his own career. One of his likely coalition partners, Avigdor Lieberman, has spoken of burning Beirut and bombing Tehran. Sharon's ideas on the furtherance of the peace process make a mockery of it. If any Israeli leader ever had the makings of a western villain, the destroyer of US interests in the region, it is surely he. Yet, within a week of the emergence of this would-be villain as Israel's premier-elect, who do the Americans and British bomb? That old, familiar, that Arab, villain, Saddam Hussein. Of course, his crimes and atrocities are of an order that words can barely encompass. Keeping him from committing more is one thing, however. The motives and methods of those who, once again, have assigned themselves that task, and the regional context in which they do so, is something else. The Americans and British say Friday's raid, the first on such a scale for more than two years, was necessitated by the upgrading of Saddam's defences and the increased threat that posed to their aircraft's routine forays over the ""no-fly zones"". Even if that argument is true, it has few takers in the Arab world. For the Arabs, the raid is an escalation of the Anglo-American campaign against Saddam, with a far greater political import than a strictly military one. Coupled with the rise of Sharon, there could hardly have been a more blatant, a more richly symbolic, display of the double standards which, in their view, typify western, but especially American, treatment of those two zones of perennial Middle East crisis, the Arab-Israeli conflict on the one hand, Iraq and the Gulf on the other. It bodes ill for both. Each crisis has its own origins and dynamics, but they are intrinsically connected. Saddam pioneered ""linkage"" when, immediately after his invasion of Kuwait in 1990, he offered to withdraw in return for an immediate, unconditional Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories. The offer was greeted with outrage in the west. But in due course ""linkage"" surreptitiously asserted itself. George Bush Sr promulgated a ""new world order"" whose cornerstone, in the Middle East, was to be a just and lasting Arab-Israeli settlement. The US's Arab allies understood that, to achieve it, the US would back away from its historic pro-Israeli bias. ""Bush,"" said President Mubarak at the time, ""agrees with me that the Israelis must be pushed into a Palestine solution."" Fairness and firmness in one crisis zone were to work wonders in the other. But it was not to be. Both crises have festered and worsened. Saddam grows stronger and more assertive. The Arab-Israeli peace process has all but collapsed; violence and mutual hatred deepens. Pernicious as these two crises are on their own, they achieve an even higher degree of malignancy through the intrinsic connection between them. And, with the ascent of Sharon, both have as their key players individuals who incarnate all that is most extreme, dangerous and destructive in the region. This, then, is the moment that the US, under a new administration, has chosen to embark on a more activist policy in one zone of crisis. The raid may please the Iraqi opposition, or some of it, as well as Gulf countries, or some of those ruling elites most threatened by Saddam, but it is deeply unpopular in the wider Arab arena. The Arabs - people especially, but governments too - have been growing steadily more hostile to American-led ""containment"" of Iraq; key Arab countries are making ever greater breaches in the UN sanctions. Indeed, supporting Iraq has become a necessary yardstick of patriotism, even for a devoutly pro-western ruler such as King Abdullah of Jordan. This is not for love of Saddam but, more than ever, because of ""linkage"" and outrage at the way the world's only superpower penalises Arabs for their misdemeanours but never its Israeli ally. ""It is clear what the US is now about,"" said an Iraqi exile in Beirut. ""It wants erring Arab regimes to correct their priorities, to re-establish Saddam, not Sharon, as the real enemy. It may have some success in the Gulf, but, in general, and unfortunately for us Iraqis who have most reason to hate him, it is turning him into an Arab champion again."" There could always be a miracle: in resorting to a new activism against Saddam, Bush could do the same against Sharon. But, judging by the lack of official alarm with which the new man was greeted, he will have to wreak a great deal of havoc before the miracle occurs and America begins to think of fairness, and objectivity, as a sensible way for saving the Middle East from the twin calamities that surely await it. dhirst@beirut.com",2001-02-19T03:03:08Z,"{'polarity': 0.11966820099731494, 'subjectivity': 0.47776179516685835}",0.47776179516685835
world/2001/apr/12/israel,You've just been visited by the Israeli army,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/12/israel,"The army called it ""Operation Enjoyable Song"". There was no warning. ""It happened all of a sudden, in the middle of the night when we were all sleeping,"" said Soraya Abu Loz. Her family has lived in Khan Yunis refugee camp since arriving as refugees from the Israeli town of Beer Sheva in 1948. Yesterday, she sat surrounded by her eight children atop the pitiful belongings she had managed to salvage from the rubble of her home: a sack of flour, and one of rice, a hand-operated sewing machine, a bouquet of plastic flowers and a colouring book. Her home was one of 30 systematically flattened by Israeli tanks and bulldozers in the first invasion of Palestinian territory since the start of a seven-month uprising. Two people were killed in the operation, which began shortly after midnight when four tanks rolled into the thickly populated refugee camp in the south of the Gaza strip. As helicopter gunships buzzed overhead and tanks shelled two blocks of flats nearby, bulldozers set about destroying a swath of civilian homes. The Israeli defence minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, said the raid was in response to mortar fire. ""These are points we don't want the Palestinians to return to. This is a clear act of defence."" The attack was launched only hours after the hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon - known as the ""Bulldozer"" for his personal predilection for razing Palestinian homes when he was military commander in the Gaza Strip in the early 1970s - announced that he had a plan for dealing with the revolt against Israel's occupation. Even by the standards of the last seven months, which have seen the Israeli army uproot thousands of olive trees and raze vast tracts of farm land in Gaza, the early morning assault on this refugee camp set a new extreme, Peter Hansen, the commissioner of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, said. He said the demolition of more than 32 shelters - housing by conservative estimates some 400 people - was the worst single act of destruction visited on the Palestinians since they began their revolt against Israel's occupation last September. It also marks Israel's first invasion of Palestinian territory since 1994, when Khan Yunis, like 60% of the Gaza Strip, came under the rule of Yasser Arafat's administration as part of the Oslo peace accords. All residents in the camp are refugees or the descendants of those who fled their homes when the Jewish state was created in 1948. Overnight, 56 families were homeless again. ""This is a pretty bad message, and it is something that looks extremely deliberate,"" Mr Hansen said. He said the UN agency would lodge an official complaint with the Israeli government. The French foreign ministry delivered its own rebuke yesterday, saying the army assault was fuelling a ""downward spiral"". The Israeli army's seven-hour attack on Khan Yunis, whose low, asbestos-roofed houses are home to some 60,000 refugees, was launched after Mr Sharon's visit to army bases in Gaza for what was reported in the Israeli press as a bristly encounter with senior military commanders. Mr Sharon is reported to have upbraided his commanders for including political content in their briefings. Referring to his own command in Gaza, he said: ""In my time, there were no such terms. We spoke less and focused on action."" But he also gave a hint of what was to come in the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli army has been confronting a new threat from Palestinian militias firing mortars on illegal Jewish settlements inside the territory, and on a nearby kibbutz which lies within the borders of the Jewish state. ""We know exactly what to do. I have a very clear plan and it will be implemented,"" Mr Sharon was quoted as saying. During the election campaign, Mr Sharon's advisers said he supported moving Israel's army into Palestinian-ruled territory - a course the former prime minister, Ehud Barak, had rejected as a violation of the peace accords. Khan Yunis was perhaps the most likely place for Israel's first invasion of Palestinian terrain. The western edge of Khan Yunis has emerged as one of the fiercest battle arenas of the uprising. An Israeli army base hugs the camp on three sides like a horseshoe, with sandbags and gun placements protecting the illegal Jewish settlement of Neve Dekalim. In the relentless exchanges of fire between soldiers and Palestinian militias, some of the refugee houses have taken so many bullets they look like they have caught a rash. But the Israeli army says Palestinian fighters have fired more than 70 mortars on Jewish settlements and army bases since February 24. Although Israeli intelligence officials say the Palestinians appear to be using homemade launchers, they say the move towards higher calibre arms is a dangerous escalation in the uprising. Israeli military officials fear it is only a matter of time before the Palestinians inflict heavy casualties. Amid increasing international concerns that the mortar war in Gaza, and yesterday's invasion of Khan Yunis, will fuel a further escalation of violence, security officials were expected to meet last night at the Tel Aviv home of the American ambassador to Israel. It was the first security meeting scheduled since last week, when Israeli soldiers shot at the returning Palestinian delegation at the Erez border crossing to the Gaza Strip. But amid the ruin of Khan Yunis yesterday, where dozens of people clambered over the detritus of their homes searching for lost belongings, there was no mood for compromise. ""Now I feel sure that aggression can only be answered with aggression,"" Mohammed Ayash, an engineer and father of seven, said. He stood on a chunk of concrete pointing out the remnants of his home: a slab of marble tiling from the bathroom, a mattress several feet away, and a computer, television set and refrigerator buried somewhere under another heap of rubble. ""The Palestinians believe in peace, but the Israelis want to treat us like master and servant."" UNRWA is setting up shelters for the new refugees in a nearby school. Mr Hansen said the UN agency would have to decide whether it would be safe to rebuild their homes where they once stood, or move them on. ""If Mr Sharon... wishes to increase the anger and hatred, and deepen the vicious circle we are in, then this is probably the way to do it,"" Mr Hansen said.

world/2001/apr/04/china.johngittings,Spy plane crisis: An explicit threat - but only in Chinese,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/04/china.johngittings,"It was China's turn yesterday to raise the stakes in the spy plane row with the United States: a series of statements piled on the pressure during the day. As so often with Chinese diplomacy, it was a mixture of tough talk and subtle hints needing careful study of the original text. The all-important threat from the Chinese foreign ministry to put the crew of the US spy plane through a potentially lengthy legal process came right at the end of an extensive statement from the ministry's spokesman, Zhu Bangzao. Even then, the threat was given only in the Chinese version - the whole phrase was omitted from the otherwise full English summary of Mr Zhu's remarks put out last night. State department analysts will be studying word by word his declaration that when China has completed its investigation, it will ""deal appropriately with the crew and plane according to law"". The verb to ""deal with"" ( chuli ) can also be translated as ""to punish"", especially when used with the phrase ""according to law"" ( yifa ). But it is a threat rather than a cast-iron commitment, no doubt designed to make Washington think again. The official followed up with another tough demand: the US should ""cooperate conscientiously with the Chinese investigation"" and make a full apology. Washington is the primary audience for this Chinese offensive, but Beijing's political tacticians will have designed it with domestic listeners in mind too. In the crisis public opinion has emerged as a factor the Chinese government must consider. A wide range of outspoken unofficial views have been expressed on popular websites - including one run by the official People's Daily newspaper. Some contributors are criticising the official line as too ""diplomatic."" ""In the past 'public opinion' was mostly dictated by what the newspapers and the government laid down,"" according to a strategic analyst in Beijing, Gao Chaoqun. ""Now it can express itself in a more independent way, particularly through the voices of younger people on the web."" The dominant mood of anger was summed up yesterday in a website message declaring that ""Blood must be repaid with blood: Americans - listen!"" ""When you are thousands of miles from our land,"" it asked, ""what pretext do you have for allowing your warplanes to fly in our airspace?"" (Beijing concedes this was not its airspace.) Other contributors bitterly recalled the US bomb that fell on Beijing's embassy in Belgrade two years ago when Nato was bombing targets across Serbia during the Kosovo conflict. Many Chinese doubt that the embassy bombing was an accident. Several called in terms once used by Mao Zedong for the Chinese people to ""stand up and not kneel down"". Some have complained that the government adopted too low a profile initially: there were sarcastic comments about the main story in Monday's People's Daily, which was said read more like an account of an official tree-planting ceremony than of a mid-air crash. Many have suggested that the government should harden its line by ""raising the price"" (as Mr Jiang has now done) for meeting US demands for the return of its 24 crew members. Outside observers are not sure whether the government is being moved by public pressure or is being steered in a direction it intends to take anyhow: perhaps both are at work. Not everyone is calling for retribution. Cautious unofficial voices have warned that too hard a line could put ammunition in the hands of the US pro-Taiwan lobby. ""We should give back the plane and its crew and show compassion,"" argued one contributor to the People's Daily website. ""Our main task is to prevent Taiwan from getting advanced weaponry from the US."" President Jiang Zemin, too, indicated yesterday that he still hopes the US-China relationship will return to a normal track. All his advisers have been urging him to give President George Bush the benefit of the doubt in spite of the anti-China noises from the new US administration. Mr Gao, the strategic analyst, said that public opinion was a short-term factor, but that the government would be more guided by the need to takea long-term view on policy towards the US. But the spy plane crisis is putting such moderation under immense strain. The existence of a US surveillance programme against China - though well known in government and military circles - has now entered the public domain in one dramatic stroke. Popular newspapers have published details - taken directly from the US media - of the capabilities and crew of the EP-3 aircraft, and of its spying operations against China. Having made the demand that such missions should stop, will Beijing pretend nothing is happening if they go on? The US claim that it was over international waters has not gone down well at the official or popular level, though Beijing admits the US plane was not in Chinese airspace. Washington's image has also suffered from its failure to express sadness over the missing Chinese airman who must now be presumed dead. The pilot was named yesterday as Wang Wei. Chinese news agencies reported that he had parachuted out of his F-8 jet after the collision but he has not been found. But the Chinese media have made a point of stressing Mr Jiang's concern about the pilot - which also took some time to emerge. Beijing's case now includes complex but significant arguments about the legality of the US spy flights. Mr Zhu argued that although the collision did not happen in Chinese airspace, it was over an ""exclusive economic zone"" which Beijing claims in the South China sea - a territorial claim that is disputed in the region. He argued that while UN law allows peaceful transit over such areas this did not cover spying activities. He also revealed that the US and China had reached an agreement last year on ""avoiding military risks in sea areas"" - which the US had now violated. The Chinese are arch-negotiators, but they are angry and not inclined to roll over to what they call US hegemonism.

world/2001/feb/26/iraq.brianwhitaker,Allies struggle to find 'smart' sanctions on Iraq,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/26/iraq.brianwhitaker,"Sanctions against Iraq are ""like Swiss cheese - that means they are not very effective,"" President George Bush said after his weekend meeting with Tony Blair. ""We're going to work together to figure out a way to make them more effective,"" he added. But, says Gary Sick of the Middle East Institute at Columbia University in New York, ""it's really hard to come up with any kind of sanctions that people have not thought about in the last 10 years"" that would pile more pressure on Saddam Hussein without harming ordinary Iraqis. Neil Partrick, of the Royal United Services Institute in London, is equally sceptical about the search for ""smart"" sanctions: ""What is proposed is not so much genuinely smart as an attempt to make sanctions appear smarter and more presentable."" Foreign Office sources acknowledge that smartness in presentation - grabbing the public relations initiative back from Saddam Hussein - will be at least as important as any changes in the sanctions. Gary Hufbauer, of the Washington-based Institute for International Economics, has studied smart - or targeted - sanctions dating back to 1932, and has found about 20 examples, usually implemented as part of a broader policy. Just five of these were successful in achieving their intended aims, he says - a worse record than the 34% success rate for sanctions in general during the 20th century. ""It's hard to say there's a silver bullet here,"" Mr Hufbauer says. ""But the silver bullet - if there is any - is that you're not imposing so much collateral damage on people who have no power."" Sanctions against Haiti in the 1990s to restore democracy were an example of the knock-out approach. After a trade embargo, the UN stopped private flights, banned visas for the junta and froze Haitian assets. These failed to achieve a return to democracy; military intervention followed. The purpose of any sanctions against Iraq is going to be unchanged: to keep pressure on the regime until it lets UN inspectors return to monitor its weapons. Weekend reports that Iraq may be just three years from acquiring nuclear weapons, and another claiming that it secretly tested a bomb in 1989, have heightened the concern. But there is doubt whether Iraq will ever allow inspectors back, regardless of the pressure. Sir John Moberly, a former British ambassador to Jordan, believes that deterrence should be the focus, so that ""if Saddam starts to deploy nuclear, chemical or biological weapons he will risk being hit extremely hard by the United States or other UN security council members"". That, he goes on, would mean rebuilding a security council consensus on Iraq, bringing France, Russia and China back on board: ""Ease sanctions but agree on a response to Iraqi deployment of weapons."" Two years ago a group of American foreign policy experts proposed a tougher plan: a ""systematic air campaign"" against President Saddam's Republican Guard and the setting up of an alternative government inside Iraq with US military and financial backing. Among this group were Donald Rumsfeld, now President Bush's defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, number two at the Pentagon, and Richard Armitage, number two at the state department. Such ideas, however, are not likely to appeal to the secretary of state, Colin Powell, who has said he believes the policy of containment is working. Targeting regime leaders is no simple matter This is what experts say about the pros and cons of ways to penalise Iraq: • Economic sanctions Nothing has done more to discredit economic sanctions than hold-ups in the delivery of essential goods to Iraq, on the grounds that they might have a military use. ""Sanctions that were genuinely smarter,"" says Neil Partrick, of the Royal United Services Institute in London, ""would shift the situation from saying that everything is forbidden, with certain exceptions, to saying that everything is permitted except some items, such as those with seriously potential dual use."" Or, says Gary Sick of Columbia University, New York, don't allow unlimited quantities of dubious items. As for exports, all Iraqi oil revenue must go into a UN account. The UN is unlikely to relinquish this lever, as it uses part of the money to feed Iraq's Kurds and compensate victims of Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait - the act that unleashed the Gulf war and led to sanctions. But easing the policy on imports could be balanced by being tougher on smuggling, to stop illicit oil getting out and weapons getting in. Border checks are far from rigorous now. Stricter ones, however, would require total support from all six of Iraq's neighbours - ""hard in the case of Jordan, Turkey and Syria. Turkey has lost a lot of trade,"" Mr Partrick says. • Travel restrictions The most successful example was the EU's ban on 600 named supporters of Serbia's former president, Slobodan Milosevic, which cut them off from their business activities around Europe. But such bans need support from a lot of countries and airlines, and can be evaded with false passports. Mr Saddam stays home. • Financial targeting Freezing the foreign bank accounts of regime leaders looks smart, but finding the accounts takes a lot of work. The tactic has had some impact elsewhere, but for a country with oil wealth it might prompt leaders simply to steal state funds, further depriving the Iraqi people of food and medicines. • Indictment Charging leaders with war crimes or crimes against humanity would be a clearly targeted move and one that countered any impression that an easing of economic sanctions meant weakness. The main issue here is timing. Actual arrests are unlikely in the near future and the threat of arrest might give the regime a further disincentive to make peace. ""It would not be particularly helpful while trying to get weapons inspectors in,"" Mr Partrick says.",2001-02-26T02:55:10Z,"{'polarity': 0.019511688708117276, 'subjectivity': 0.39563576304647735}",0.39563576304647735
world/2001/jun/05/zimbabwe.chrismcgreal,Mugabe's man dies,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/05/zimbabwe.chrismcgreal,"Few will mourn the death yesterday of Chenjerai ""Hitler"" Hunzvi, the ""war veterans"" leader who, as much as Robert Mugabe, spearheaded the invasion of hundreds of white farms in Zimbabwe and led his supporters to murder with impunity. Drivers in Harare made clear their feelings about the death of the man who never actually fought in the liberation struggle against the white Rhodesian government as they honked their horns in celebration. But outside the hospital ward where Hunzvi died yesterday, his supporters stood vigil and vowed revenge on the celebrants. Almost everyone was left wondering what it will mean for Zimbabwe to lose a man who was more widely loathed than Mr Mugabe, yet also wildly popular among his supporters. The war veterans' leader was one of the very few who dared to threaten and cajole the president, and he arguably posed as much a potential threat to Mr Mugabe's power as any political opponent. But so long as Hunzvi was on the president's side, he was also Mr Mugabe's greatest asset as the leader of the shock troops in the assault on the political threat to Zanu-PF's rule. Hunzvi, 51, collapsed a fortnight ago and was confined to a heavily guarded hospital room. The official diagnosis was malaria but his battle with Aids was well known and evident from the occasional infections that afflicted his face. Hunzvi, a qualified doctor, first reared his head in the public consciousness five years ago when he was accused of ripping off a government fund to pay compensation to veterans of the liberation war. He allegedly greatly exaggerated the extent of their injuries, and invented a few for himself even though he never took up a gun against Ian Smith's white regime. In 1997 he was elected head of the war veterans. He proved a dynamic leader, transforming a do-nothing organisation of has-beens into the most threatening and powerful group in the country. Initially the group turned against Mr Mugabe when Hunzvi forcefully demanded hefty pensions and ""gratuities"" for the 40,000 war veterans. Zimbabwe's president was unused to threats and, realising that the potential power of the war veterans could be used against him or by him, reached a swift compromise. The old soldiers got their money - although Hunzvi stood accused of embezzling about £500,000 of it - and Mr Mugabe got a private army. He was to need it, because the hefty, unbudgeted cost of buying the war veterans off triggered Zimbabwe's economic crisis and helped turned public opinion even more against the president. After Hunzvi was let loose, he liked to be called Hitler. ""Do you know why they call me Hitler?"" he spat at a white farm manager last year. ""It is because I am the biggest terrorist in Zimbabwe. I am the most dangerous man in this country. And you must do what I tell you."" There were not many in Zimbabwe - friend or foe - who disagreed with that description. Hunzvi spearheaded the violent invasions of 1,800 white-owned farms. Nineteen people were murdered - 12 black labourers and seven white farmers - in the process. Countless others were beaten. Some were raped. After the assault on the farms was under way, Hunzvi turned his attention to last June's parliamentary election campaign. The war veterans were let loose on the opposition Movement for Democratic Change and its supporters, killing 40 people and brutalising thousands more. The violence and a good bit of rigging helped Mr Mugabe retain control of parliament by a slender margin. When the election results were challenged in the courts, witnesses prepared to testify against Hunzvi were singled out and beaten. Hunzvi's reward was a seat in parliament for the Chikomba constituency. In the last two months Hunzvi sent his veterans to invade more than 100 factories, beat up managers - black and white - and extort large sums of money. Inevitably, the favoured targets were companies thought to fund the opposition. The war veterans' leader was no respecter of diplomatic protection either. He bluntly threatened foreign diplomats and last month his war veterans assaulted the Canadian high commissioner to Zimbabwe, prompting the Ottawa government to halt all financial aid and impose other diplomatic sanctions. Neither was Hunzvi reluctant to set an example to his men. He publicly beat opposition supporters with an iron bar and human rights groups accused him of personally torturing Mr Mugabe's opponents in his medical rooms during the parliamentary campaign. Earlier this year Hunzvi threw a petrol bomb at four opposition members of parliament and ordered 60 of his followers to beat them. ""Why should we observe the law? This is our country and we can do what we like,"" Hunzvi said. In case there was any doubt, Mr Mugabe settled the issue by effectively decreeing the war veterans above the law with an amnesty for political crimes. Hunzvi claimed that ""Hitler"" was his nom de guerre during the war against white rule in Rhodesia, but he spent most of the conflict in eastern Europe, in Poland, where he qualified as a doctor. He returned to Zimbabwe when it gained independence in 1980. The man who later said he hated all whites brought with him a Polish wife with whom he had a son. But the wife was spirited back to Poland by friends after accusing Hunzvi of beating her badly. She has since written an exceedingly unflattering book about her husband. Hunzvi's death is the latest in a series of setbacks for Mr Mugabe. In the space of two months, he has lost four high-level supporters, including his firebrand employment minister, Border Gezi, who died in a car accident. Gezi worked closely with Hunzvi and the war veterans. In May, Mr Mugabe's trusted defence minister, Moven Mahachi, also died in a car accident. It is widely suspected that the ir deaths were not accidents but the result of score settling within Zanu-PF. A third cabinet member, trade minister Nkosana Moyo, resigned in early May to protest the factory invasions. Mr Moyo moved his family out of the country and faxed his resignation to Mr Mugabe, apparently fearful of retribution. The cabal with which Mr Mugabe maintained his rule now appears in disarray, but the opposition is cowed and in no position to take advantage. Still, he will find it difficult to replace Chenjerai Hunzvi, who brought a frightening flair to his threats and thuggery. Hunzvi's war veterans are already squabbling over who will succeed him and a violent contest is expected. Likewise, the many rival groups within Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party will be scrambling to fill the newly vacant cabinet posts. The bad luck that has befallen Mr Mugabe and his party has led to some surprisingly high level speculation, including from the speaker of the house, Emmerson Mnangagwa, that it is down to witchcraft. So potent is the rumour that Hunzvi refused to see several of his followers in his last days because he said he was afraid they would cast a spell on him. As it is, he has left a curse on Zimbabwe.

world/2001/jan/16/armstrade.comment,Comment: Depleted uranium compensation claims,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/16/armstrade.comment,"Ten years ago today, a coalition led by the US launched a massive air and land attack to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. The fall-out is still with us, and not only because Saddam remains in power, refusing to allow in UN weapons inspectors or because US and British aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones continue to attack Iraqi targets. The war also bequeathed its legacy of huge and unexplained health problems which have left over 5,000 British veterans ill, and more than 500 dead, over 130 from cancer. A decade ago, Colin Powell, then the US top military officer and from next week secretary of state, practised his doctrine of ""overwhelming force"". For the first time British and US soldiers went into battle armed with shells tipped with depleted uranium. DU shells, as John Spellar, the British junior minister, explained in the Commons last week, are ""ideally suited for use as a kinetic energy penetrator in anti-armour munitions"". They also have potentially serious health risks, an unsurprising fact which the Pentagon has been warning about for decades. The Ministry of Defence here also drew up health warnings. They were given to some bomb disposal units before the war, but not to other soldiers, including tank crews. Jeremy Hanley, Spellar's predecessor, told the Labour MP Paul Flynn in 1993 that the omission was ""regrettable"", but was attributable to the ""urgency attached to bringing into service such a critical capability"". Last year, Spellar said a warning to British troops advising on how to avoid breathing in DU dust never reached its destination. These failures could yet lead the ministry open to the charge of negligence. The MoD insists there is no evidence of DU causing illnesses among veterans. Yet it has undermined its own publicly stated confidence by the nature of its reaction to the concern sweeping across Europe about the possible effect of DU on veterans from Bosnia and Kosovo (and civilians living in the battlefields there). While governments across Europe set up special screening programmes, ministers here kept mum. When the Guardian reported the MoD had changed its mind, officials denied the story. The next day, Spellar confirmed the u-turn but confined it to Balkans veterans. Unsurprisingly since many more DU rounds were fired in the Gulf war than in the Balkans, veterans of that conflict were furious. A few days later, on his return from Sweden, Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, announced it would be extended to Gulf war vets. Anger compounded by a deep lack of trust in the MoD led to a spate of leaked reports, some from inside the ministry, some from the US, showing how exposure to DU could cause cancer. One MoD report, first dismissed by officials as the work of a ""trainee"", turned out to have been written by what it now calls an ""experienced military officer"". The officer was not apparently experienced ""in that particular area"", though his report was endorsed by senior personnel. The MoD downplayed the risk of cancer from insoluble DU dust - stressed in the MoD report as well as American ones - and leaned on other scientific studies to dismiss DU as a cause of leukaemia, the illness which sparked off the recent outcry (partly politically inspired) in Italy. The MoD discredits leaked reports, saying that the only reliable ones are those it officially publishes. Put another way, it only publishes reassuring reports. Certainly, it has a strong vested interest in suppressing information which could open itself up to demands for compensation. The MoD says that ""given the concern and confusion"" the leaked documents have generated, it now intends to publish them ""with a suitable commentary"". But the ministry also admits it has not yet devised an effective test for DU screening and awaits a report from the Royal Society. We wait to see whether the MoD's promise of publication includes the full report on which a leaked summary concluding that DU dust increased the risks of ""lung, lymph and brain cancers"" was based. The warning has been dismissed by Sir Keith O'Nions, the MoD's chief scientific adviser, as ""not part of the advice given to ministers"". Then we learn that the American manufacturer of DU-tipped weapons used in the Phalanx anti-missile system used on US and British ships is ending production replacing DU by tungsten. In 1989, the US navy noted that the ""tungsten penetrator provides improved... effectiveness while eliminating safety and environmental problems associated with DU"". The MoD says it will not phase out Phalanx weapons until they have been used up, probably by the year 2003. The problem, it says, is that it is more expensive. It is not surprising that vets do not trust the MoD, a ministry with a track record of concealing information, including the presence of organophosphates used in pre-Gulf war vaccinations. The previous government had to apologise for that. Hoon, a cautious lawyer, might be wise to distance himself from his scientists. richard.norton-taylor @theguardian.com",2001-01-16T08:42:04Z,"{'polarity': 0.1136190476190476, 'subjectivity': 0.43746031746031727}",0.43746031746031727
world/2001/jan/12/armstrade1,Depleted uranium online debate,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/12/armstrade1,"Read the first part of the debate caymantinsel Mark, according to the Italian press, it was a wizard wheeze of those at Sellafield who tout for business to dispose of the world's nuclear waste - what better idea than to turn it into weapons, use them on our enemies (who we've already demonised into perceived subhumanity) and then leave them to clear it up. MalcolmHooper caymantinsel- there are 4 major reasons why DU is used 1. It is cheap - provided at low cost or at no cost. There are around 1 million tons of the waste product from the nuclear industry lying around the world. It is intermediate nuclear waste and therefore must be monitored, stored and cannot be buried. A very costly process. Anything to reduce this stockpile and make money is welcome 2. It makes a very powerful weapon. 3. Any advantage to the USA and the UK has been lost by selling it other countries- at least 17 have these weapons including Pakistan/India, Taiwan/China, Egypt/Israel etc BIG BUCKS ARE INVOLVED WAR PROFITEERS (INTERNATIONAL ARMS TRADE) WILL LOSE OUT- PRINCIPALLY THE UK AND USA 4. Clean-up costs are colossal for 69 tons of DU fired at the jefferson proving grounds clean-up was estimated at $4-5 BILLION. the USA did not agree to clean up the Gulf battlefields Malcolm H silvere I have some few questions about this affair. First, at this stage the talks seem to be limited between NATO members and whether depleted uranium weapons might be toxic or not. But let's do some ""politic-fiction"", UN soldiers won't be the only ones to show some health troubles, the civil population might be hit as well. So is it possible to see in the future years Kosovo sue at an International Court (TPI in French) NATO and more precisely America for empoisenement? Secondly I really don't see why the ban on depleted uranium weapons shouldn't pass. I remind some people that not so long ago Europe decided a complete ban on the well-know ""farines animales"". Why do we have the feeling that every time governements are dealing with lobbies the rule seems to be ""Let's do whatever we fancy and if afterwards casualties occur we'll correct some drifts""? Ian70 Mark, the connection is by no means clear. As a question, several posters have pointed to the effects on the local population. Ibrahim Rugova, the elected leader of the Kosovo Albanians, has stated this; 'the depleted uranium scare is being misused by those who opposed the NATO intervention in the hope that it would lead to the withdrawl of the NATO-led peacekeeping force.' This newspaper also quoted Pleurat Sejdiu, joint head of the Kosovo health department, Sejdiu dismissed the concerns as 'propoganda'. What do they know that we don't? NortonTaylor Ian70, Sure the wave of concern in Europe is partly political - the Kosovo bombing was very unpopular in Italy for example. But equally Rugova is making a political point. A more general point - raised by others - we talk about Nato veterans, but what about those - including children - close to DU bombsights - in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq ? NortonTaylor Hello,I'm Richard Norton-Taylor, security editor of the Guardian. I'm in no way a scientist but i have been following (and trying to uncover) Government secrecy for many years. I'm here now and look forward to seeing your questions. Keep them coming. youngphilosopher Why is depleted uranium used at all in the shells? NortonTaylor youngphilosopher, because it's hard and because it's a very cheap product - a byproduct of the nuclear industry. Defence companies have developed tungsten shells but it is more expensive and (say governments) not as efficient. Only 3 nuclear powers - the US, Britain, and France, produce DU-coated weapons. MalcolmHooper I would add also that DU is pyrophoric- it catches fire on impact giving rise to intense fires of ~10,000 degrees centigrade the dust cloud produced can contain up to 70% of respirable small particles ~1 mg. A sabot fin round contains 5,350 gm of DU other munitions vary down to 200 gm. We are not dealing with DU coated munitions it is solid 100 % uranium (strictly ~ 99.8% uranium -238 and ~ 0.2% uranium -235) that is used in the munitions.

Best wishes Terry Gooding - Editor UK-GWVN Scottish Area Co-Ordinator Gulf Veterans Association. An Active Member of The SNP. caymantinsel Hello Richard, I read today that Robertson's answer to the Italian request for a moratorium was an extremely dismissive and disingenous one - nothing to discuss, there's no war now they they're not currently being used anyway. Is this the seriousness that the government of a member state of Nato can expect when it is mandated by parliament to ask about something that is of concern to its population? How much would you like to bet that next time there is a war, Robertson or his successor'll tell us there's not time for such discussions in time of war? jamalade Is there the old first world war ""gulf"" division between the arrogance of the upper echelons of the army and the humble soldier on the ground; do these people have colleagues in the nulcear industry whom they consulted and were informed that DU's were ""safe""; and, will we be sure that these ""colleagues"" will not be benefitting (esp. financially), in the inevitable clean-up industry that will follow when we are sued? NortonTaylor caymantinsel - You remind me of a letter a defence minister - Jeremy Hanley - wrote in 1993. He told the Labour MP, Paul Flynn that the government did not give advice to British troops in the 1991 Gulf war about the dangers of DU weapons because of the 'urgency attached to bringing into service such a critical capability which at the start of the crisis was still under development'. Spellar told MPs on Tuesday that DU weapons were 'ideally suited for kinetic-energy penetration'. Meatloaf What is the likelihood of Nato forces having used other types of chemical/toxic weapons in recent conflicts? NortonTaylor Meatloaf, The ministry of defence is developing a heat-and-pressure-bomb for urban warfare. Devastating effect on anybody caught up in the blast - said by US researchers to be similar to that of a tactical nuclear bomb. tamara What did the army use before DU? Were the old weapons really not very good - as the MoD seems to be saying? jamalade Is there a difference between using ""weapons of mass destruction"" and DUs, that may harm populations for generations to come? Saramago DU tipped shells are said to be used for armour piercing. We are told that some 31 000 such shells were used in the Kosovo conflict. In view of the fact that only 13 tanks and perhaps double that of armoured vehicles were destroyed, would you say that DU tipped shells were used for other targets in Kosovo? NortonTaylor Saramago, Maybe not intentionally. But they could well have landed on other targets which US pilots thought were the sites of Serb tanks and armour. Ian70 Very good point. Although of course, APC's and trucks will have been attacked raising the number of targets struck, and the potential exposure. Only 26? The alternative explanation is that a lot of shells are lying around, that missed their targets, that pose no threat to anyone. NortonTaylor To all, One of the problems in all this is that history has shown you cannot trust the Ministry of Defence, certainly can't take its assurances at face value. It is not surprising, it has a huge vested interest - not least, in protecting itself against claims for compensation and negligence. (Secrecy and bureaucratic and financial considerations are not, of course, confined to the MoD in Whitehall. The MoD refused even to recognise the existence of a 'Gulf War syndrome' until well after the US agreed there was reason for concern. (Not that the US has been completely open, far from it). There is another point - in complex areas involving scientific research, ministers have to rely on their expert advisers. Too many ministers don't ask the difficult questions. jsd104 Depleted Uranium is radioactive. Radioactivity is dangerous. QED. The idea that DU is safe, being pedalled by the likes of George Robertson is patently false. He is either a liar, or he is stupid. Of course, it is unfortunate if soldiers from any country have been contaminated by this poison. But they at least could have been expected to have some idea that it was dangerous. But what about the Kosovan Albanians for whom our politicians shed such huge crocodile tears in 1999? Here are some of the reported effects of DU. Journalist Felicity Arbuthnot visited southern Iraq and reported in 1999 that ""Iraq's leukemia rate has leapt 70 percent since the Gulf War"". As well as such cancers, she found ""an astonishing rise in congenital abnormalities"". She described seeing in one hospital a typical victim, ""a baby born an hour ago. ""The tiny being made small bleating noises. It had no genitalia, no eyes, nose, tongue, oesophagus or hands. Twisted legs were joined by a thick web of flesh from the knees."" She reported that ""vegetation in the area shows up to 84 times background radiation"". The potential effects on pregnant women are all too obvious. Bosnia has suffered similarly. After US forces bombed the Ramont Institute near the town of Brataunac in 1995 Yugoslav scientists reported: ""There are unusual and unnatural occurrences in vegetation, among animals and human beings. Bizarre, massive illness has affected cows. Rapid hair loss is happening to boys of school age."" An official investigation by the United Nations Environment Programme in Kosovo this year confirmed fears of depleted uranium contamination. Head of the programme Pekka Haavisto said, ""There remains a risk for the local population. Much ammunition is deep in the ground and affects groundwater."" DU is a weapon of mass destruction and those authorising its use are guilty of war crimes. Ian70 DU has very low levels of radioactivity, so do many other materials, everywhere has background radioactivity. Everywhere is not dangerous. You have proved nothing. See my other post to bring some doubt on the role of DU in Iraq. Quoting official sources from Yugoslavia, prior to October 2000, is even more dangerous than trusting the MOD. NortonTaylor Well, I'm off now to hear what the MoD is saying next. Keep at it and thanks for your contributions.

world/2001/apr/27/nelsonmandela,Peter Lennon on rebuilding South Africa's culture,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/27/nelsonmandela,"""Because we voted,"" Hugh Masekela says, ""the world thinks we are now OK. But we are not. That is the great secret"". It's lunchtime in a sunny suburban Johannesburg restaurant and the famous trumpeter swaps ideas with vocalist Sibongile Khumalo about life, culture and politics in that alternatively humorous and passionate way one often encounters in people from South Africa's townships. On Sunday, Masekela will be in Trafalgar Square, helping to lead a raucous celebration of South Africa's liberation struggle, but today he does not appear to be in celebratory mood. When I ask him what cultural line the ANC has adopted since coming to power, he replies: ""TV and casinos."" Then, in mock terror, he shouts: ""I'm going to jail. I'm going to jail."" He goes on: ""With every revolution there is always an element of amnesia and the people who lead are the most amnesiac!"" High on Masekela's list of dismaying developments are the four grotesque Las Vegas-style casinos that have sprung up around Johannesburg - with creches for babies so mother can more easily hand over the housekeeping money. But he is equally exasperated by South African TV, which, with rare exceptions, conforms to a homogenised western formula. ""It is not that black people working in TV don't want to show who they are,"" he says. ""They don't know who they are."" Masekela's gloomy assessment of the cultural climate provides a discordant note to the six-week Celebrate South Africa festival, which will see a host of the country's brightest talents performing in London. ""The black intelligentsia need to tell [the government] what they are doing wrong,"" he says. ""When we had the most draconian rulers we were prepared to speak out, go to jail. But people don't want to speak out."" What is there to speak out about? Well, apart from Masekela's complaint that ""in other countries people dress up to go out, but we dress up to stay at home"" - a reference to the perceived lawlessness of some areas - the arguments are, predictably, about whose culture is being neglected and which unfavourably favoured. Many black South Africans feel that their long-suppressed cultures should now be a prime concern of the government. ""But every year,"" Masekela says, ""when the budget comes up the dispensation for the arts decreases."" Masekela's artistic anguish and doubt is not typical of black South Africans; the overwhelming impression you bring away from the townships and settlements is one of astounding confidence and hope and pride in the success of their uniquely civilised revolution. Meanwhile a white minority is incensed by the government's refusal to continue bailing out national classical orchestras or maintain a level of support for ballet and opera. (One white South African has a brisk solution for the white culture dilemma: ""Have your classical concerts and ballet,"" says Eve Gray, a publishing consultant, ""but make them work. I saw a performance of Wagner with a black township chorus. It added a new dimension to the work."") Some white South Africans are convinced that the ANC is actually intent on stifling white art, a belief reinforced by events such as last week's Nadine Gordimer incident. A committee of teachers appointed by the education department of Gauteng province were accused of ""political correctness gone mad"" when they accused Gordimer's July's People of being ""deeply racist, superior and patronising"". Although the education minister immediately accused the teachers of being ""ill informed and pedagogically unsound"" and sent his apologies to Gordimer, the apprehension still smoulders. The ANC government goes to some lengths to present itself as a patron of the arts, remembering the central role of the world's artistic community in persuading foreign governments to take a stand against apartheid. Indigenous art adorns the country's constitutional court building. Albie Sachs, the former ANC activist who lost an arm in a car bomb planted by agents of the South African security forces, is now one of the country's constitutional judges. He took on the job of what he calls ""decorator"" for the court, filling the vestibule and corridors with South African artworks.""We were engaged in turning our country from the polecat of the world into a distinctive democracy,"" he says. ""We rented this office block. We had little money so had to rely on people's generosity and passion, energy and madness - all kinds of emotions not normally associated with a court of law."" The result is that the blind lady with the scales is replaced by a high panel of a solemn figure, flattened hands upraised in a gesture suggesting both the lifting of a burden and a restrained gesture of jubilation. Corridor after corridor reflects the tumultuous experiences, griefs and hopes of the country. Madness is represented by a kind of quixotic, generously hung witchdoctor apparently gibbering before solemn Justice. ""This is the latest addition,"" Sachs explains. ""If we had put it in first you can imagine how the good judges would have freaked."" Brigitte Mabandla, deputy minister responsible for the arts, insisted the ANC had merely diverted funds from costly buildings and bureaucracy to on-the-ground performances, as well as redirecting more money to the townships. In the townships, though, few are convinced that they are likely to be properly supported. Many in the arts world also point out that the ministry now responsible for the arts is also responsible for science and technology - it isn't difficult, they say, to see where the spending priorities will be in a developing nation. Even with far greater sums of money than the South African government has at its disposal, one or more of the country's numerous ethnic groups (and 11 official languages) would undoubtedly feel neglected. Khumalo and Masekela, who have now devoted themselves to promoting indigenous music, fear that they are very vulnerable to being swallowed up by western cultures. ""One problem,"" Masekela says, ""is that the whites can't think of themselves as African."" But artists such as Masekela and Khumalo face a further obstacle: black opposition to indigenous culture. ""If you want to appreciate these cultures,"" Khumalo says, ""it is seen as tribalism or promoting ethnicity."" This does not discourage all entrepreneurial spirit. Lopang Manyama had to leave school when she became pregnant. To care for her child she got a job with a music promoter. Now she manages exclusively Zulu groups, singing in their own language. They have already had success in Scandinavia. When it comes to literature, meanwhile, the South African public seems to be suffering from ""battle fatigue"" which means ""struggle"" literature no longer has a following. When Athol Fugard brought out a book of poetic memoirs, it had little to do with politics. But the public saw the name Fugard, equated it with struggle literature, and did not buy. Some say that the literature was not very democratic anyway; it was intellectuals telling people what they should think. Guidance now comes from another source: while the sale of books has halved, the sale of magazines which tell people how they should look, dress, act - the new revolutionary guides - has doubled. Over the next two nights at the North Sea Jazz festival in Cape Town it was difficult to detect any trace of Masekela's scepticism. Khumalo and he were back in business. Khumalo driving the crowd wild with her fantastic duels with a violinist, with back-up from some of the most talented young singers in South Africa.

world/2001/jan/25/worlddispatch.kurds,World dispatch: What's in a name? Too much in Turkey,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/25/worlddispatch.kurds,"A plan by Abdullah Akin, the mayor of Batman in south-east Turkey, to change some of his town's street names seemed pretty unremarkable at first glance. But Mr Akin's choices, which included imaginative constructions like Mahatma Gandhi Street, Democracy Avenue and Human Rights Boulevard, proved too much for the Turkish government. The Ankara-appointed provincial governor objected, and last week a court ruled that since Gandhi's name was associated with passive resistance to a colonial power and glorified revolt, it could not be used. The same went for 14 of Mr Akin's other seemingly innocent choices. The court added, for good measure, that streets in Batman must not be given Kurdish names. And therein lies the explanation for the Kurdish mayor's difficulties - and one of several reasons why Turkey's bid to join the European Union, due to be set out in detail by the Ankara government this month, faces some very big obstacles. So insecure is the Turkish government about its grip on the predominantly Kurdish areas of the south-east, where most of the country's estimated 12m Kurds live, that it continues to stamp down hard on any manifestation of a separate Kurdish identity. Officially, the Kurds are not recognised as Kurds at all, but as Turkish citizens. Despite a change of tone under the government of Bulent Ecevit, restrictions on broadcasting and teaching in the Kurdish language remain in force. More broadly, attempts to assert Kurdish ""cultural rights"" or pursue political self-determination bring a routinely harsh response. At the heart of Ankara's insecurity is the separatist movement spearheaded by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The war with the PKK has cost an estimated 30,000 lives since 1984. The PKK declared a unilateral ceasefire after the capture of its leader, Abdullah Ocalan, in 1999, and renounced its previous demands for a separate Kurdish state in favour of enhanced cultural freedoms. But the government has not taken the PKK at its word and the Turkish army continues to mount counter-insurgency operations that not infrequently take its troops into Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. Prosecutions of suspected PKK sympathisers have not ceased either, whoever they may be. Earlier this week, the Turkish authorities in Diyarbakir, near Batman, said they would charge 13 juveniles, including one nine-year-old, with ""aiding and abetting"" the PKK. The youths' ""crime"" was allegedly to shout pro-PKK slogans. Their families say they have been tortured while in detention. If found guilty, they face up to seven years in jail. The infringement of freedoms and rights considered sacrosanct by EU countries and international bodies is not confined to Turkey's Kurds. The Turkish government is also at war with militant groups such as the Revolutionary People's Liberation Front and the Islamist faction, Hizbullah. The leftwing RPLF were responsible for a suicide bomb attack that killed a policeman earlier this month. The group said it had acted in revenge for the violent storming by the Turkish army in December of 20 prisons where inmates were on hunger strike. At least 30 prisoners died. Hizbullah, which shares the aims of the Iranian-backed group of the same name, is equally reviled by the government (and by many Kurds). It advocates the creation of an Islamic state in predominantly Muslim, but traditionally secular Turkey. Hizbullah is suspected of being behind the latest upsurge in violence - the ambush and killing of Diyarbakir's police chief and five policemen on Wednesday. The crackdown on Islamists has in effect been going on since February 1997, when the army conspired to oust the government led by Necmettin Erbakan of the Islamist Welfare party. Welfare has been a banned organisation since 1998 and legal moves are afoot to ban Virtue, another Islamist party. ""The process (launched in 1997) will continue for 1,000 years if need be,"" the chief of Turkey's general staff, Huseyin Kivrikoglu, said recently. The military, backed by rightwing elements within the governing coalition, is meanwhile pushing for a purge from government service of suspected Islamist sympathisers. Even in Turkish society at large, the penal code restricts freedoms of speech and publication taken for granted elsewhere. Prosecutions of journalists, academics and others who breach these regulations are commonplace. This week, a demonstration was mounted in Ankara in support of the Anatolia news agency after it was accused by the government of being too informative in its reporting of a high-level government corruption case. Batman was also in the news after a radio station that played a Kurdish song, entitled I Am Wounded, was ordered off the air for 90 days. The suppression of Kurdish rights, the sometimes violent crackdowns and repression levelled at the left and right, the interference of the military in politics, the disregard for political pluralism, the restrictions on free speech, and a pattern of disrespect, bordering on contempt, for basic human rights are all issues that are certain to bedevil, and possibly scupper, Mr Ecevit's hopes of getting Turkey into the EU. Add to that this week's furious row with France over its condemnation of the 1915 Armenian massacres as ""genocide"", Turkey's disputes with Greece and Cyprus and its fragile economic situation, and Turkey's EU accession begins to look like an ever more distant prospect.

world/2001/apr/14/comment.israelandthepalestinians,Comment: The Middle East: The real deal,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/14/comment.israelandthepalestinians,"On the edge of Jerusalem, in a hollow in the hills, is a sad sight, the ruins of an abandoned Arab village. It has been empty since 1948, a victim of the conflict between Arabs and Israelis. It is a quiet spot. The stone is old, and the columns and curves belong to a very different architectural tradition from the red-roofed modern Israeli houses that surround it. Today, there are new ruins. This week, the Israeli army bulldozed 30 homes, adding to the many already destroyed elsewhere in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank. The Palestinians are paying a heavy price for the uprising they began in September: more than 370 dead and an economy destroyed. The response of most Israeli liberals is to agree that the Palestinians are suffering but that the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, is to blame: he should have accepted the peace proposals put to him by the then Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the then US president, Bill Clinton, at Camp David last year and at Taba earlier this year. It is a view widely shared internationally, and one that the Israeli government is happy to project: that a generous deal was put on the table for Arafat and he missed the historic opportunity. The reality is that it may turn out to be Israel's missed opportunity. There are two basic Israeli views of how to deal with its neighbour, the future state of Palestine. There is the liberal version put forward by the Israeli foreign minister, Shimon Peres, of an economically healthy Israel co-existing alongside an equally economically healthy Palestinian state. Together they could be at the centre of a revitalised Middle East. Unfortunately, it is the other Israeli view that has long been dominant and is prevalent today: to have a weak, malleable Palestinian neighbour. Thomas Friedman, the New York Times journalist, writes in his account of his 10 years in the Middle East, From Beirut To Jerusalem, about how the Israelis have never quite managed to give up hopes of controlling all of biblical Israel, which includes the West Bank. That is what motivates the movement of Jewish settlers out into the Palestinian Wild West, the source of most of today's conflict. Friedman and a host of other journalists and academics have recorded how Israeli politicians since the founding of the state in 1948 have talked peace while grabbing land. While Barak put seemingly generous offers on the table, Jewish settlers continued to expand into the West Bank, which they call by the biblical name, Judea and Samaria. Demographic maps of the Middle East since 1948, the year Israel was founded, show a steady expansion of the Jewish population eastwards. Arab East Jerusalem today is being gradually surrounded by Jewish homes. Even within Jerusalem's Old City, Israelis are spreading into Arab neighbourhoods. A Palestinian this week, spotting for the first time new Jewish houses on the outskirts of Jerusalem, said: ""It is like a magic wand. You go away for a few weeks and then suddenly there is a whole new place."" The Israeli government, supposedly committed to no new settlements, announced this week a further 700 new houses. The Israeli government finds it easy to keep to its commitment to build no new settlements: because there are so many already on the West Bank, all it has to do is just keep expanding existing ones. It is against this background that Barak's ""generous"" deal should be seen. The Israelis portrayed it as the Palestinians receiving 96% of the West Bank. But the figure is misleading. The Israelis did not include parts of the West Bank they had already appropriated. The Palestine that would have emerged from such a settlement would not have been viable. It would have been in about half-a-dozen chunks, with huge Jewish settlements in between - a Middle East Bantustan. The Israeli army would also have retained the proposed Palestinian state's eastern border, the Jordan valley, for six to 10 years and, more significantly, another strip along the Dead Sea coast for an unspecified period: so much for being an independent state. Israel could afford to be magnanimous in terms of territory, given the amount it has gained over the last century at the expense of the Palestinians, many of whom fled or abandoned their homes for Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and elsewhere. Compromises were discussed at Camp David and Taba on the right of return of the 3.5m Palestinian refugees, but nothing that Arafat could take away to sell to his own people. In spite of the protestations of Israeli liberals such as Amos Oz that to allow back 3.5m Palestinians would be suicidal for Israel, a solution was possible. The Israeli view that 3.5m Palestinian refugees would flood into Israel is a nonsense. What the Palestinians are looking for is something akin to an apology from the Israelis for taking their land. Israel could allow a few hundred thousand back and pay - or get the US or Japan or Europe to pay - compensation to the remainder, most of whom would stay where they now live. One proposal on the table was for a land swap: the Palestinians would get part of Israel proper next to the West Bank in return for Israel taking part of the West Bank. Arafat could have taken this deal to the refugees and said: ""Look, you are going back to Israel, as I promised."" Barak could just as easily have said: ""Look, it is no longer Israel but the West Bank."" Solutions were possible, but in the end Barak would not give on the right of return. A genuinely generous offer by Barak might have secured peace. That was the missed historic opportunity. If Israel had been more magnanimous at Camp David, it could have had the greater prize of long-term stability. There is a huge danger attached to the Israeli view that Arafat spurned a great offer. Accepting this version perpetuates the Israeli myth that the Palestinians will not be happy until the Jews are pushed back into the sea and that the West Bank and Gaza are full of gunmen and bombers intent on making that happen. There are such people - but most Palestinians are interested less in the destruction of Israel than in establishing a proper Palestinian state. Most are as exercised about the poor quality of the leadership round Arafat and about the endemic corruption and lack of democracy in their own society as they are about Israel. What they want is for the Israeli army to go home and to take the Jewish settlers with them. There will be no peace until that happens. Nothing in the career of the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, suggests he will do that. Instead, he will continue with the subjugation of the Palestinians and grabbing more of their land. The only safe bet is that there are going to be a lot more Palestinian ruins.

world/2001/jun/02/julianborger.martinhodgson,US proxy war on drug barons,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/02/julianborger.martinhodgson,"When a small plane carrying US missionaries was shot down a few weeks ago in Peru, killing a young woman and her seven-month-old baby girl, it first seemed to be a tragic case of trigger-happy policing by the Peruvian air force. But as more details emerge from the Andean jungle, it is clear this apparently isolated incident has a far greater significance. The deaths have helped yank the covers from the secret side of America's billion-dollar drug war in Latin America. The missionaries' plane was shot down by a Peruvian military pilot, but it was first spotted and targeted by a US Cessna Citation surveillance plane patrolling the air routes between Peru and Colombia on the look out for cocaine traffickers. The surveillance plane was piloted not by US military pilots but by private contractors who, according to US congressional officials, were hired by an Alabama-based company called Aviation Development Corporation (ADC). In the words of one outraged official: ""There were just businessmen in that plane. They were accountable to no one but their bottom line."" A state department inquiry is still taking place into the deaths of Veronica and Charity Bowers, the victims of the April 20 shootdown. Administration sources quoted in the US press suggested that the American Cessna crew cautioned their Peruvian air force counterparts against shooting the plane down, but no one is denying it was the Cessna that wrongly identified the missionaries' plane as suspect. Moreover, the involvement of a US firm operating for profit over the Peruvian and Colombian jungles has drawn attention to an important but little-noticed trend - the privatisation of the drug war. Congress is now trying to investigate the role of the commercial contractors and two bills have been proposed to try to curb their influence. Their chances of success in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives are unclear, but their sponsors are determined to force the administration to at least explain its actions. ""We are hiring a private army,"" Janice Schakowsky, a Democratic congresswoman who authored one of the bills, told the Guardian. ""We are engaging in a secret war, and the American people need to be told why."" A private corporation based in Virginia called DynCorp carries out much of the aerial spraying of coca plantations in Colombia. When a police helicopter was shot down in February by the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, DynCorp sent in its own armed security men, in a search-and-rescue helicopter, who exchanged fire with the rebels and brought the policemen to safety. DynCorp pilots also ferry Colombian troops in and out of battle, and train Colombian helicopter and fixed-wing pilots. Another US company, AirScan, based in Florida, works alongside ADC carrying out aerial surveillance in Colombia, using state-of-the-art imaging to pinpoint coca fields and guerrillas trying to bomb the Cano Limon oil pipeline. Meanwhile, Military Professional Resources Inc, another Virginia-based consultancy group set up by former generals, has carried out officer training for the Colombian police and army. The rise of the private contractor is arguably an inevitable outcome of US anti-drug policy under Bill Clinton and now President Bush. Last year, Congress approved $1.3bn expenditure on Plan Colombia, an ambitious programme of military aid to Bogota to try to stem the flow of drugs at the supply end. But, concerned that Colombia could become a Vietnam-like quagmire, Congress imposed a cap on official US military involvement of 500 trainers and advisers. Into the gaping and lucrative gap stepped US commercial enterprise. Richard White, a former ambassador to El Salvador, sees the trend towards privatisation as a symptom of Washington's failure to come to terms with its own military-based anti-drug strategy. Mr White, now head of the Centre for International Policy, said: ""I believe it's dishonourable for the US to resort to mercenaries to carry out its policy. If we are committed to intervening in Colombia in pursuit of US interests, then we should mobilise whatever military resources we need to accomplish this."" This is not the first time the US has resorted to mercenaries. The exploits of the pilots who flew in south-east Asia for the CIA front company, Air America, are legendary. As today in Colombia and Peru, Air America provided Washington with distance and deniability. But it was a CIA-run operation. Today's mercenaries in the drug war are provided by private companies selling a service and are used as a matter of course by both the state and defence. In the Vietnam days, secrecy was justified by national security. In the current drug war, it is a matter of corporate confidentiality. Janet Wineriter, a spokeswoman at DynCorp's headquarters in Reston, near Washington's Dulles airport, said she could not discuss DynCorp's operations in Colombia because of its contractual obligations to its client, the state department. Scott Harris, the spokesman for the state department's bureau for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, said he could not comment because of the contractor's right to privacy. Similarly, ADC diverts inquiries to its Alabama lawyer, Mike Waters, who refused comment on grounds of ""normal client confidentiality"". Lynis Cox, a civilian public affairs officer at Maxwell air force base, from where ADC has operated since 1998, said: ""I know they have a hangar out there on the base, but no one here seems to know much about them."" In Bogota, government officials are also tight-lipped about the increasingly unpopular privatisation of the conflict. A helicopter pilot in the Colombian anti-narcotics police said: ""From Bush down, they want to cover up what they're doing. Not even the president wants to talk about private companies flying fumigation missions here in Colombia."" Members of US Congress are having similar problems getting information. Ms Schakowsky said the house sub-committee on government reform was being stonewalled by the state department and other federal agencies over the role of private contractors. ""The CIA did not even show up,"" she said. ""Why is this classified if taxpayers' money is being spent?"" A copy of DynCorp's five-year, $200m contract obtained by the Guardian is vague, with little about its rules of engagement. Under the heading ""Search and Rescue"", for example, it stipulates only: ""This operation deals with downed aircraft or hostile action by narcotics producers or traffickers."" Major Andy Messing, who served as a US adviser in El Salvador and worked as a military consultant in Colombia, warned: ""If there had been a US air force pilot in that plane in Peru, you can bet the Peruvians would have listened to him. The private guys have no authority. They are all potential hostages."" Three years ago a paper written at the Army War College by a Colonel Bruce Grant warned: ""Foreign policy is [being] made by default [by] private military consultants motivated by bottom-line profits."" Now, Major Messing argues, the warning is coming true: ""DynCorp's guys are old geezers who've retired, and they're down there making $109,000 tax-free. ""Every time you have contractors this is what happens. They just prolong the whole mess."" The firms fighting America's drug war DynCorp Based Reston, Virginia Description A huge corporation that supplies electronics and a range of contract services to the US government, which provides most of DynCorp's $1.4bn in business. It is also under scrutiny for its role in training US members of the UN police force in Bosnia Role in drug war It has a five-year, $200m contract to provide crop-dusting pilots for eradication of coca plantations and helicopter pilots to ferry Colombian troops and DynCorp's own ""security"" personnel Aviation Development Corporation Based Maxwell air force base, Alabama Description A secretive company set up in 1998 to test aerial electronic sensors Role in drug war It flies Cessna spotter planes for the CIA in Peru and possibly Colombia to help target aircraft used by drug smugglers AirScan Based Rockledge, Florida Description Provides state-of-the-art air surveillance, also used in Angola Role in the drug war Patrols the Colombian jungle in Cessna Skymaster electronic surveillance planes, seeking out coca plantations and guerrilla threats to the Cano Limon oil pipeline Military Professional Resources Inc Based Alexandria, Virginia Description A consultancy set up by former US generals.

world/2001/jan/23/chechnya.iantraynor,Chechen rebels face a new enemy,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/23/chechnya.iantraynor,"Sixteen months into Russia's savage war of attrition in Chechnya and with no end in sight, President Vladimir Putin yesterday stripped his army generals of their command of the campaign and put the domestic security service, the main successor to the KGB, in charge of the Chechnya war. In what appeared to be a vote of no confidence in the generals' ability to tame the Chechen rebels, despite repeated bragging that they have been crushed, Mr Putin put a close ally, Nikolai Patrushev, head of the FSB (domestic security service), in command and ordered him to report on his progress by mid-May. Moscow says it has 80,000 troops in Chechnya struggling to contain what it puts at 1,000 guerrillas. But by the official tally, widely seen as too low, the Russians are being killed at the rate of more than 160 a month, with almost 500 being wounded as the rebels use ruthless hit-and-run tactics. Its principal garrison Gudermes, long under ostensible Russian control and the headquarters for the civil administration of Chechnya, is the latest battleground, according to Russian media yesterday. Guerrillas attacked the main hospital on Sunday, keeping Russian troops under fire for eight hours before melting away into the darkness. According to the Chechens, they left 20 Russian soldiers dead. Moscow admitted losing four soldiers and confirmed that many were injured in a cafe bomb blast in Gudermes. The guerrillas are also targeting ""collaborationist"" members of the pro-Moscow Chechen administration and its local supporters every week. The lightning speed of the attack highlights the vulnerability of the Russian conscripts, who hole up each evening in converted schools and public buildings, surrounded by mines and barbed wire. They live in fear of the rebels who attack checkpoints, mine roads and ambush Russian convoys. Sergei Ponomarenko, a Russian who recently resigned as a local government chief in Chechnya, told the newspaper Izvestiya that the guerrillas - who routinely ignore curfews and distribute propaganda leaflets ""to show who's really boss"" - have seized the initiative. When Chechen snipers hit a Russian, Moscow's forces commonly respond with indiscriminate artillery barrages which maim and kill civilians or launch ""cleansing"" raids on villages and towns, dragging away males of fighting age. ""This has turned into a war against an entire civilian population. That's a fact, that's the reality,"" Ruslan Khasbulatov, a former Russian parliamentary leader and himself a Chechen, told the Russian government recently. Russian or loyalist Chechen administrators and military officers, meanwhile, are using their positions to line their pockets, Mr Ponomarenko said, an assertion echoed by Mr Khasbulatov who said the generals wanted the war to go on because of the opportunities for plundering and profiteering. Mr Putin's move yesterday may be an attempt to break this cycle of viciousness and seal a victory in Chechnya. But it also seems a counsel of despair. The president recently described Chechnya as the source of ""Russia's national shame"". It also propelled him to power in 1999. Yesterday's move was a snub to the army generals who, according to Mr Khasbulatov, are deliberately prolonging the war to enhance their clout in Russian politics and to exact retribution for their defeat in the last Chechen war of 1994-96. In a decree that took immediate effect, Mr Putin put Mr Patrushev, who succeeded him as head of the FSB in 1999, in charge. The transfer of command was seen as another sign of the growing power of the security services under Mr Putin, a former career KGB officer. The Kremlin also announced troop cuts in Chechnya, making it plain that the emphasis would be on the use of elite ""anti-terrorist"" FSB and crack army units. All the signs are that there will be a strong Russian spring offensive to end the war by May and proclaim victory. With no political solution in sight and scant effort made to find one, public support for the war is ebbing and Mr Putin may be calculating that he needs to settle. Mr Putin has instructed that the troops numbers be cut. ""I have decided today on a partial withdrawal from the republic,"" he declared yesterday. ""This does not mean the end of the counter-terrorism operation. On the contrary it will be continued, not less intensively, but with different means and forces and with a different emphasis."" The war would now be waged by ""FSB and interior ministry forces and defence ministry special units"". A motorised infantry division of 15,000 men and a 7,000-strong brigade of interior ministry troops would remain deployed. It was not clear how many troops were being pulled out or when. Mr Putin also talked up the possibilities of implementing new civil administration plans to revive the economy. The plan is to plough £60m into Chechnya reconstruction this year. But Russian civilian administrators are currently quitting their posts in frustration at the Kremlin and the military, complaining that no money is available for the restoration of the most rudimentary services and that anything of value in Chechnya is plundered by the Russian troops. Mr Putin stated recently that his priority in Chechnya was ""social rehabilitation and economic recovery"", but a senior Kremlin aide told Mr Ponomarenko: ""There is no programme yet for restoring the republic, so there's no point putting any money in."" The president said the command was being passed to the FSB since constitutionally this is the body charged with combating terrorism. It is true that by law the army is for fighting foreign wars and defending against external aggression rather than to crush domestic insurgency, but in Chechnya such niceties have been ignored for the past 16 months.",2001-01-23T03:16:19Z,"{'polarity': 0.037856179208918934, 'subjectivity': 0.2541637015952084}",0.2541637015952084

world/2001/jan/05/balkans,Nato urged to clean up its uranium debris in Kosovo,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/05/balkans,"Nato should dispose of large fragments of depleted uranium (DU) ammunition remaining in Kosovo 18 months after the conflict ended, because they represent an unnecessary risk to health, a UN study says. Further details of the preliminary results of the UN Environment Programme investigation emerged yesterday as the EU began an inquiry into whether there is a link between radioactive military debris and the death from cancer of soldiers who served in the Balkans. Meanwhile, the European commission president, Romano Prodi, called for DU-coated shells to be banned, after the French defence ministry said that four French soldiers who served in the Balkans during Nato's bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 were being treated for leukaemia in a military hospital. ""It is clear that if there is even a minimal risk, these arms must be abolished,"" he said. ""And even if this risk was not there, I don't like the idea of using these particular weapons"". Britain remains one of the few countries to resist compulsory screening of troops returning from Kosovo for traces of contamination. The ministry of defence insisted that in its solid form was not a health hazard. ""The UN's initial findings were that there were a lot of other things which were of far greater concern,"" a spokesman said. Italy opened an inquiry last week into a possible link between DU and 30 cases of serious illness in troops who served in the area, 12 of whom developed cancer. Five have already died of leukaemia. The Campaign Against Depleted Uranium in Manchester says that most of the areas where DU shells were dropped during the Kosovo war are in the south, in the Italian sector. Spain said it would examine all the 32,000 soldiers who have served in the Balkans since 1992. Portugal, Finland, Turkey, Bulgaria and Greece also plan to screen their peacekeepers and check radiation levels to discover if there is such a condition as ""Balkans syndrome"". The biologist leading the Royal Society's inquiry into the long-term effects of DU weapons, Professor Brian Spratt of Oxford University, called on the government to test British troops. ""The leukaemia cases are probably not related, but the health of soldiers who go out to fight for their country should be taken seriously,"" he said. In its preliminary statement, the UN said it had found ""slightly higher"" radioactivity in Kosovo at eight of the 11 sites examined last November. Nato had given details of 112 sites where an estimated 31,000 rounds of armour-piercing DU ammunition were used during attacks on Serb targets. A US army officer on the team, who helped develop DU ammunition, was apparently surprised to find that it had not vapourised or dispersed. The UN statement said that its scientists had found ""either slightly higher amounts of Beta-radiation, specifically at or around the holes left by DU ammunition, or remnants of ammunitions, such as sabots and penetrators"". The team collected seven DU outer casings and seven penetrators. ""It is an extra risk for the population, and that is something that military experts were surprised to find,"" Pekka Haavisto, the Finnish head of the mission, said yesterday. There is also concern about mine clearance, because most DU was found in heavily mined areas or sites with unexploded ordinance - some of which is cleared by controlled explosions. The UN believes this can turn DU back into its most dangerous form - a dust that can be inhaled. What is depleted uranium? Tim Radford, science editor Natural uranium is a mix of different isotopes, including a small proportion of very radioactive U-235. The proportion of U-235 is concentrated for atomic fuel rods, and what is left over is depleted U-238. This has a radioactive half life of 4.5bn years, that is, it would take roughly the lifetime of the solar system for half of a lump of U-238 to break down into something else. It remains, however, radioactive. ""In contact, you could get quite a sizeable dose [of radiation], but a few inches away, it's gone,"" Michael Clark of Britain's National Radiological Protection Board said. The rays from depleted uranium, or DU, may not be particularly penetrating but the substance itself is one of the densest metals available. It is therefore desirable as a military shell casing. Its density enhances military firepower. Tungsten splinters when it hits the hard steel of a tank; DU penetrates and catches fire, which makes it a perfect weapon for armour-piercing shells. These were first used in the Gulf war, when US forces fired almost 1m rounds into Kuwait and Iraq. Nato forces fired more than 30,000 rounds in Kosovo and 10,000 in Bosnia, inevitably leaving fragments and particles behind. Leukaemia is linked to radiation exposure. The connection was observed among the survivors of the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki more than 50 years ago. Because DU ignites on impact, it leaves behind clouds of potentially toxic uranium oxide dust. The fear is this dust could lodge in the lungs and be hazardous. But scientists aren't so sure. ""The calculations show that you would have to inhale almost choking amounts to get appreciable lung dust,"" said Dr Clark. ""You would see kidney problems due to its chemical action before you saw any radiation problems.""",2001-01-05T01:26:44Z,"{'polarity': 0.0389764239028945, 'subjectivity': 0.4085492530345472}",0.4085492530345472
world/2001/mar/29/argentina.alexbellos,Will Cavallo's knife cure Argentina's ills?,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/29/argentina.alexbellos,"Winds of up to 100km/h blew four-metre waves from the River Plate across the coastal embankment and brought a taste of an early southern winter to Buenos Aires last week. To the millions left jobless by Domingo Cavallo's free-market economic programme during the 1990s, the return of ""Super-Mingo"" to the economy ministry was as ominous as the flash floods that the surprise storm caused in many parts of the city. He arrived back at the helm as Argentina, long the wealthiest nation in Latin America, felt the pressure of a deepening political, social and economic crisis. Strikes left its majestic capital, Buenos Aires, without buses and other public services, schools were closed, and thousands of protesters filled the Plaza de Mayo in front of President Fernando de la Rua's governmental palace. A bomb exploded at the premises of a political party led by Mr Cavallo, appointed last week as Argentina's third economy minister in as many weeks - a man seen by Wall Street as a white knight but by much of the population as promising more hardship. ""We don't see the slightest chance that Cavallo's policies will bring relief to those who really need it,"" Hugo Moyano said at a gathering of his powerful CGT labour federation. ""But we do know that Cavallo's first measure was to confirm De la Rua as president,"" the trade union boss quipped. Yet a lot is now riding on Mr Cavallo, and not just in Argentina. The fear is that the country could become the new Thailand, where the rush to the exit by international investors in the summer of 1997 precipitated the financial crisis across Southeast Asia and beyond in 1997 and 1998. The Economist Intelligence Unit last week warned of a possible downgrade to its rating for Argentina, and with global stock markets in the middle of a prolonged nose dive and the world's biggest economy, the United States, standing on the brink of recession, the risk is that a collapse in Argentina could prove contagious. Latin American finance ministers have already expressed concern that the crisis in Latin America's second-biggest economy could scare off investors and push up their borrowing costs. ""It affects the credit ratings of the whole region,"" Peru's economy minister, Javier Silva Ruete, said at the close of last week's Inter-American Development Bank annual meeting. ""With Cavallo's experience, we trust he will be able to take adequate action to overcome Argentina's problems and avert contagion to our countries."" Not everybody is so confident. Gerard Lyons, chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank, is compiling a league table of those countries' crash resistance. ""Argentina is currently in bottom position, he said. ""Contagion is a real concern."" Argentina is by no means a carbon copy of Thailand or Indonesia in 1997. There, the problem was an excess of liquidity. Banks borrowed massively in dollars but lent in local currency, relying on the Thai baht maintaining its peg against the greenback. The Argentine peso is also pegged against the dollar, but at a one-for-one exchange rate that has kept the economy deep in the doldrums for years. As such, it is not just a case of the new finance minister announcing a package of austerity measures to choke off excess demand and put the economy back on the straight and narrow. Argentina has been in recession for nigh on three years. At 10%, real interest rates are crippling, unemployment is running at around 15%, prices are falling in the shops, living standards are declining. All this at a time when the rest of the world has been growing steadily. Yet Mr Cavallo's first act will not be to announce a Keynesian reflation programme involving cheaper money and increases in spending. Instead, he will have to try to ram a $3bn package of cuts through parliament. Why? Because Argentina has been the beneficiary of a massive support package from the International Monetary Fund, and the only way to keep the men from Washington on side is to stick to the tight exchange rate regime. Abandoning the dollar peg would make it far more expensive to finance Argentina's debt, and raise fears of a relapse into the years of hyper-inflation, which Mr Cavallo brought to an end in the first half of the 1990s. Argentina, in other words, is caught in the same dilemma as Britain was in 1992, when the weakness of the real economy was crying out for lower interest rates and a devaluation of sterling, but the government's commitment to the exchange rate mechanism deprived it of the flexibility it needed. So what happens now? The problem is that the economic crisis has sparked a political one. Attempts by Mr Cavallo's predecessor, Ricardo López Murphy, to address the country's economic difficulties split the ruling coalition, and few politicians seem to have the appetite for the unpopularity that forcing through yet more austerity will almost certainly bring. Already the opposition Peronists have rejected calls for a national government, and unrest has spilled on to the streets. As the thousands of workers protesting against the government flooded the Plaza de Mayo and marched through the country's other main cities, blocking avenues and attacking public buildings, university students in Buenos Aires brought their desks and benches out of the lecture halls and held classes on the city's main avenues, creating traffic chaos throughout the week. ""He's not going to last,"" said 46-year-old architect Mariano Gómez, ""one man alone is not enough to fix this situation."" Businesswoman Cora Iriart, walking past students holding a class on the wide avenue in front of the law faculty, agreed. ""Can Cavallo pull off this miracle? I don't think so. He's a face from the past."" If the social upheaval were not traumatic enough, more than 20 cases of foot-and-mouth disease were confirmed last week in the worst outbreak since the cattle-exporting country was declared free of the virus. This country of 36m people has also been hit by a high-profile money-laundering scandal. Yet, for all the difficulties, Mr Cavallo is seen as the one man with a chance of pulling off what would be little short of a miracle. His handling of the economy in the early 90s won him admirers at home and among the international investment community. What he would like to do is tough it out, hoping that a show of strength will keep the IMF and its $40bn of support on board. If that proves impossible, if he is unable to forge the political consensus necessary to get his painful measures through parliament, he has only three options: devaluation, dollarisation or default. None appeals. Devaluation might allow the domestic economy breathing space but would make paying Argentina's debt more expensive and wreck Mr Cavallo's own credibility. Dollarisation would tie Argentina's policy to that of the US when the Americans are struggling to keep their own house in order. In the last resort, default is preferable to a prolonged economic slump, but it would blow the country's credit rating out of the water and scare off foreign investors. It could also prompt holders of emerging market debt to rush for the exit. When panic sets in, lenders are often inclined to lump countries into risk categories rather than consider them on an individual basis. If Argentina goes, Brazil - where interest rates were raised to defend the real last week - will be next in the spotlight, even though the country has recovered impressively from its own financial crisis in early 1999. According to Mr Lyons, the likes of Indonesia and South Africa would feel a chill wind, too. ""At the moment, Argentina is rooted to the bottom of my league table,"" he said. ""But there are other strugglers.""",2001-03-29T11:58:38Z,"{'polarity': 0.0641840621713503, 'subjectivity': 0.36786356299068174}",0.36786356299068174
world/2001/jun/10/eu.politics1,Irish give Europe the jitters,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/10/eu.politics1,"They had one battered fax machine, a few dozen mobile phones and a few thousand pounds. Lacking even an office, they used the Dublin premises of a local union for their meetings. At times Roger Cole, the head of the umbrella Peace and Neutrality Alliance which oversaw the campaign for the 'No to Nice' vote, imagined its task was far too great. His disparate bag of environmentalists, students, pacifists and republicans had vowed to overturn the weight of Taoiseach Bertie Ahern's electioneering machine and prove the opinion polls wrong. But it wasn't until last Saturday morning that he was convinced they would succeed. 'I picked up the newspaper, saw a poll which put the don't knows at 28 per cent for the first time and thought that was it. We'd win now,' he said. By this weekend Cole's coalition had detonated a bomb under the European Union's plans for eastward expansion, denting the hopes of candidate countries including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Marked by the lowest turnout ever for an Irish referendum - just 34 per cent - the treaty was rejected by 54 per cent to 46 per cent. Despite reassuring noises from the likes of European Commission President Romano Prodi that expansion would continue regardless, this weekend officials across Europe were wondering how to repair the damage caused by Ireland's No vote. And in the process Cole and his supporters had given hope to Eurosceptics across a continent. One month ago Irish ratification of the Nice treaty had appeared a foregone conclusion. Ireland has always been an enthusiastic supporter and beneficiary of European integration. There was no reason to suggest this occasion was any different. Campaigning in support of the treaty designed to extend the boundaries of the EU to the east was therefore low-key, with an occasional poster nebulously promising 'a brighter Europe'. On RTE television, Ahern warned he would be embarrassed if the vote went against Nice. Mainstream opposition parties also chided that the Irish would appear 'inward-looking and self-satisfied' if they were to reject the treaty. 'People were being treated as imbeciles. It was a case of accept this or we'll look stupid. That was the beginning of their downfall,' said John Gormley, a Green Party member of the Dail. As polling day drew closer, it became clear that people were extremely confused as to what the treaty meant. The issue of European expansion was gradually pushed to the background in favour of a debate on Irish neutrality, and the implications of the creation of a two-tier Europe where large member states would wield power over newly admitted countries. An editorial in the tabloid Star improbably prophesied that, if the treaty were accepted, young Irish people would soon be returning in body bags from far-flung wars. 'We have always been good Europeans - even nice Europeans - but we don't always have to be Nice,' it read. Others groups in the No campaign had different agendas. On Tuesday Dr Sean O'Domhnaill, a prominent anti-abortion campaigner, left the Dublin city centre hospital where he works and travelled across town to the High Court where he sought to bring an injunction against Ahern. Days earlier, Ahern had accused O'Domhnaill of receiving funds from right-wing organisations in the United States to help fund the No campaign. In the end, the 33-year-old father of four lost his case and had costs of £20,000 awarded against him. But as the chief returning officer declared the referendum results on Friday evening, O'Domhnaill's grin belied his financial problems. 'We're delighted. We've always rejected Europe's attempts to extend liberal social laws across the continent and this vote means the Irish people agree with us.' As resounding No votes continued to come in from all but two of the Republic's 41 constituencies, more No campaigners arrived at the count HQ. The victors cut an odd group, comprising everything from suit-wearing barristers to hippies sporting flowers and Birkenstock shoes. Just before 5pm on Friday when the anti-abortion faction let out a whoop for television cameras, a socialist ally winced and said there would be separate celebrations later. 'Normally we'd have nothing to to with these people, but we did what was necessary,' he said. The act of rebellion by the Irish electorate against its political masters is still echoing around a stunned Europe. The failure of the Irish to ratify the Nice treaty has torpedoed for the time being Europe's biggest project - the expanion of the EU. It has also cast a pall over this week's Gothenberg summit that was to have set the timetable for expansion east. In Eastern Europe's candidate countries, Ireland's No vote has been greeted with horror. In Hungary, the referendum result could not have come at a worst time, at the end of a week in which it had completed the complex overhaul of its currency in preparation for membership. In Poland, while official statements sought to calm nerves, in private officials were said to be scared by what it might mean for the country, potentially a big player in the future of Europe with its 40 million inhabitants. The Czech Republic, another front-runner, interpreted the result as a 'bad signal' for East European candidates. The No vote also set the scene for further trouble for the treaty from a most unexpected quarter. Taking heart from Ireland's rejection, France's most pro-European party, backed by former President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, will lead attempts to wreck the Nice treaty during a parliamentary debate on ratification on Tuesday. The opposition Union for French Democracy (UDF), founded by Giscard, congratulated the Irish for rejecting the agreement - rushed through by the French EU presidency in Nice in December - and expressed the hope that 'this disastrous treaty is now dead before it lives'. In Ireland yesterday the anti-treaty lobby united again to reject reports that its crusade had contrived to keep former Eastern bloc countries out. 'At the very beginning of this campaign, we wrote to the ambassadors of all the applicant countries and explained we are not against them joining. That is a powerful misreading of the situation,' said Roger Cole. 'But we are against being part of a super state army. We spent too long trying to escape the British Empire to want to join a new empire now.' The umbrella alliance played down the low turnout (34.79 per cent) in its victory. But election pundits agreed that the fact that it rained on Thursday may have had much to do with the outcome. Yesterday a sheepish Ahern insisted that the Republic remains strongly committed to the EU and expansion, but acknowledged that there were deep anxieties among the Irish people about the democratic process within a wider union. The rejection of Nice represents a personal blow for him, made worse by the fact that his central Dublin constituency recorded the second highest No vote. He will now travel to the EU summit in Gothenberg on Thursday intent on seeking a way out of the impasse. Despite the vehement opposition of the No campaigners, this means the way will almost certainly be paved for another referendum before the end of the 2002 treaty deadline. Rurai Quinn, the Labour leader, blamed Ahern, claiming the Taoiseach moved too quickly for selfish party reasons to proceed with the referendum. 'The treaty does not have to be ratified until the end of the year 2002 and the only reason we were asked to vote on this on Thursday was simply to clear the decks so that a referendum in the autumn or next spring would not have interfered with the Taoiseach's options in regard to the choice of date of the next general election.' But Brian Cowen, the Foreign Minister, blamed the defeat on the No campaign's 'misinformation' about Nice's implications. Cowen now has the unenviable task of going to Brussels and explaining to Ireland's EU partners why the Republic, which gained so much European largesse, had rejected enlargement. One of the big winners of the referendum was Sinn Fein, at the forefront of opposition to Nice. Gerry Adams, its president, welcomed 'the democratic outcome'. Dana, who represents the West of Ireland in the European Parliament under her married name Rosemary Scallon, was 'absolutely delighted' with the result. The victorious 'all kinds of everything' coalition that rocked the establishment on Friday also had a little help from some unusual friends across the Irish Sea. The Observer has learnt that the Bruges Group paid for large poster sites with anti-Nice messages across Dublin in the campaign's last week. The Eurosceptical Bruges group was named after the Belgian town where Margaret Thatcher invented Euroscepticism in the late 1980s. The defeat of the Nice treaty is clearly not just a warning to Bertie Ahern and the Irish government, but also to Tony Blair. The re-elected British Prime Minister should certainly take note of how fears about loss of sovereignty and national identity turned one of the EU's most Euro-enthusiastic states into a nation of Eurosceptics. After almost 30 years the Irish Republic's love affair with Europe is over. The state that benefited more than any other from the EU's expansion from the 1970s has voted down a treaty that would have allowed under-developed nations in the East from coming into the European club. A spectre is haunting Ireland this weekend, the spectre of Euroscepticism.

world/2001/jan/19/worlddispatch,Saddam's happy Arab family,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/19/worlddispatch,"The commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Gulf war in Baghdad this week was a subdued affair. Saddam Hussein's speech, in which he hailed Iraq's military defeat as a victory, cannot have carried much resonance for the average Iraqi. Even his son Uday has warned parliament that people are becoming disaffected - especially with government officials who blame sanctions for their own incompetence and corruption. It was a different story in Gaza, where hundreds of Palestinians marked the anniversary with an enthusiastic demonstration in praise of Saddam. ""The Palestinian and the Iraqi peoples are in the first trench against Zionism, imperialism and aggression,"" one of the banners said. Some Palestinians are so enthusiastic about Saddam that they name their babies after him and small children in the streets chant: ""Saddam, Saddam, come and bomb Tel Aviv."" A Guardian journalist recently visited a family in Gaza who had lost a son in the intifada. On the wall above the boy's empty bed hung a large picture of the Iraqi leader; on the opposite wall, a certificate of martyrdom bearing an Iraqi flag and another picture of Saddam. Iraq had given the family $10,000 compensation for their loss, which they planned to spend on home improvements and medical treatment for one of the boy's brothers. It is understandable, of course, that Palestinians should welcome help from wherever it comes, but I wonder if that is entirely wise. Last week I was talking to an Arab ambassador who is far from lukewarm on the Palestinian question, and I found him furious about Iraq's behaviour. ""Saddam is an embarrassment,"" he said. ""What he's doing won't help the Palestinians at all. It's for his own benefit, not theirs."" One example is Saddam's demand that more than $800m be diverted from the UN's Oil for Food programme to aid the Palestinians. There is little doubt that the real motive behind this is not to help the Palestinians but to put the UN on the spot and drive another hole in the sanctions regime. One might nevertheless argue that if the Palestinians benefit as a result, then good luck to them. But the motivation of benefactors does matter - as we have seen in Britain recently in a controversy over donations to political parties. Suppose that bereaved families in Gaza started receiving gifts of $10,000 from the Kentucky Fried Chicken company, together with certificates of martyrdom signed by the genial Colonel Sanders. Would anyone have qualms about it? The idea is not totally ridiculous. Both Pepsi and McDonalds (or at least some of their franchise holders in Arab countries) have been donating a share of profits to provide medical aid for Palestinians. In both cases the motive was perfectly clear: to protect their businesses by dissociating themselves from American policy towards Israel. Many people were delighted and marketing experts praised this as a brilliant example of enlightened self-interest. Nobody seems to have condemned the move as an exploitation of other people's misfortune for cynical commercial reasons (which would be another way of looking at it). It could also be argued that the Palestinians have no alternative to accepting support from Saddam, Pepsi, McDonalds, or whoever, because others - especially in the Arab world - have let them down so often in the past. Support from other Arab leaders has, of course, increased since the intifada began, though it is widely regarded as weak and insincere, prompted by Arab leaders' fears of losing credibility with their own people if they failed to make a stand. Another case of enlightened self-interest, perhaps. At the Arab summit in Cairo last October, Crown Prince Abdullah did Saudi Arabia's reputation a lot of good by initiating the $1bn al-Aqsa Fund and making some carefully-worded criticisms of American policy in his speech. There was no great cost, political or financial. The Saudis have plenty of money and the prince's complaints against the US were far from strident. But the Saudis are close allies of the US and the prince's words were more likely to be taken seriously in Washington than anything that Saddam Hussein says. In comparison with the largely non-existent statements on Palestine made by another American ally - Britain's Tony Blair - the prince's remarks look positively courageous. Last Tuesday, Saddam Hussein met the head of the PLO's political department, Farouk Kadoumi in Baghdad and called - once again - for the destruction of Israel and for a ""Palestine from the river [Jordan] to the sea."" He urged Jordan and Syria to let his army pass through their countries and attack Israel. Saddam can safely say this because there is no chance of being allowed to carry out his threat. It does, however, enhance his prestige on the street. Whether it helps the Palestinians is another matter. Possibly he imagines the Israelis will be so terrified that they will quickly sue for peace - though that seems unlikely. Iraq's Scud missile attacks on Israel during the Gulf war served to muddy the waters over the main issue (the invasion of Kuwait) but actually caused only token damage in Israel. Saddam's threats against Israel are almost certainly little more than rhetoric - though with Saddam we can never be entirely sure. The trouble is that they provide ammunition for those Israelis who claim that the Arabs do not really want peace, and that any settlement with the Palestinians would be a trap, leading only to more conflict.

world/2001/jan/01/israel,Peace eludes Bethlehem,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/01/israel,"Yigal Ohana, an Israeli student, and Nick Makhlouf, a Palestinian casino worker, live directly opposite one another, separated by one of the most beautiful valleys in Israel. It is famous for its olives and, during the last three months, for its gun battles. As the death toll in the region rises and the chances of a diplomatic settlement recede, pessimism on both sides of the valley is pervasive. Mr Ohana's and Mr Makhlouf's houses are on the frontline, only 500 metres apart, and they can clearly see one another's hilltop homes. Mr Makhlouf's home is part of the Palestinian West Bank; Mr Ohana's is disputed, with the Palestinians claiming it is part of the West Bank, though in any peace agreement it will almost certainly go to Israel. Mr Ohana, aged 32, lives on Ha'anafa Street, in the mainly Jewish settlement of Gilo, with his mother, father, brother and sister. His flat stands out, flying an Australian flag rather than the Israeli one his neighbours fly. He lived in Melbourne for seven years, working in fast-food joints, and says: ""I put up the Israeli flag at first, but it did not help much. A soldier was shot outside my window."" Before a two-week lull in fighting around Christmas, he says, the shooting from Beit Jalla, the Palestinian-Christian village across the valley, often began at 5pm, as night fell, and continued beyond midnight. ""When the shooting begins, we close the windows and turn off the lights. The windows have thick double-glazing."" Would that stop a bullet? ""I do not know. I guess so."" But the family takes no chances, opting to huddle in the kitchen. A bullet would then have to pass through two walls. The value of their house has dropped by 35% since the Palestinian uprising began, as have others nearby. Some families have opted to leave. His family, which has lived in Gilo since it was established almost 20 years ago, intends to stay, though he would like to go to Australia. He holds out no hope of a deal between the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, that would satisfy both sides. Mr Ohana is no die-hard rightwinger, and dismisses as ""fanatics"" the Israeli settlers entrenched in the more isolated parts of the West Bank. But when the election for prime minister comes on February 6, he will back the hardliner Ariel Sharon. Mr Sharon will be more hawkish, he says. ""Once the goverment changes, we will see things change."" The Palestinians know Mr Sharon will not negotiate until the shooting has stopped. Since September, tens of thousands of bullets have been exchanged across the valley, and most houses on the frontline in Gilo have bullet holes. The damage on the Palestinian side is much worse, because the Israelis respond with machine-guns, tanks and helicopter gunships. In Beit Jalla, previously a lovely village, many of the houses are ruined. Mr Makhlouf, looking across the valley to Mr Ohana's home, says: ""I hope they [the politicians] get this peace agreement and end this war."" But, even if they do sign an agreement, he does not expect it to end the 52-year-old conflict: ""You can have peace on paper but the real issue - feeling safe in your home - I do not think it will happen."" Like Mr Ohana, he has lived abroad, studying in Canada for five years. Aged 24, he works in Jericho, managing slot-machines in a casino that is now closed because of the fighting. He lives in Baton Street, with his mother and father and two younger brothers, and, until recently, his grandparents. His father made souvenirs from olive wood, but is redundant because there are no tourists. His mother is a cleaner. He accuses the Israelis of reacting with excessive force: ""The only thing they have not hit us with is a small nuclear bomb."" His uncle's house next door was hit by a helicopter gunship missile which passed through three walls. ""As soon as we hear gunfire, we hide. It is not safe here. We are in the line of fire."" His grandfather, Hanna, 75, handicapped and unable to join the rush to safety in the basement of a neighbour's house, has taken refuge in Canada. ""Four days after he left, the veranda was hit,"" Mr Makhlouf says. It was 4.45pm, the time when his grandfather usually sat there. He dismisses the US peace proposals. He does not believe that the Haram al-Sharif holy site in Jerusalem can be divided between Palestinians and Jews. And, whatever the practical difficulties, the Palestinian refugees scattered round the Middle East should retain the right to return. The US wants them to give this up. He is apprehensive at the prospect of Mr Sharon becoming prime minister: ""He hates Arabs very bad. He has lots of hatred for the Palestinians.""

world/2001/jan/03/israel3,Dangerous talk of war,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/03/israel3,"Ehud Barak has instructed his military commanders to draw up contingency plans for a regional war, as the smaller but still uglier conflict between Israel and the Palestinians rages unchecked. To some extent, no doubt, the Israeli prime minister is sabre-rattling. As a former army chief himself, he can't resist reminding his Arab neighbours who is top dog in the Middle East. But there is a real danger that the talk of war will turn into something more substantial and infinitely more horrible. It is fairly clear now that the peace process in its present form is dying, if not dead. It has been mortally wounded by the Palestinian intifada (uprising), now in its fourth bloody month. The coup de grace is likely to be administered by the incoming George W Bush administration in Washington. Bush's line on the Middle East is likely to be markedly different from that of his predecessor. Bill Clinton devoted huge amounts of time, energy and emotion to the region. Bush, in his election campaign, paid scant attention to foreign affairs. When Bush takes over the White House, his attention is likely to be dominated by domestic concerns. He will, according to US commentators, be happy to delegate diplomatic policy to his Secretary of State, Colin Powell, and Powell's deputy, Edward Djerijian. Both men have widespread knowledge of, and interest in, the Middle East. But - and this could be a vital factor in the coming months and years - their primary concern is to shore up US interests in the oil-producing nations of the Arabian peninsula, and contain the perceived threat to those interests posed by Iran and Iraq. In the perception of the Bush team, the Israel-Palestine dispute is a second-division issue. It is unthinkable that any Washington administration would cut America's umbilical link with Israel, which US taxpayers subsidises to the tune of some $3bn a year. But the Israelis, after eight years of fawning reassurances from the White House, are going to have to work much harder for presidential patronage. They are already trying. Israel is loudly crying wolf over the latest boast by Saddam Hussain that he will ""solve the Zionist problem once and for all"". The threat is bombastic, almost comically so, but Israelis who remember Iraq's Scud missile bombardment of their cities during the Desert Storm war ten years ago are not likely to see the joke. Nor, of course, is ex-general Colin Powell, who led the Desert Storm allies. Saddam is once again assuming the mantle he loves best: that of leader of the entire Arab nation. There lies the real threat. To most Westerners, he may seem a clown, albeit a bloody-handed one. To many Arabs, he is indeed a leader; one who not only articulates their hatred of Israel, but is prepared to take on the might of the USA. Saddam is a threat not only to Israel, but to its neighbours, especially Egypt and Jordan. They are the only Arab nations with embassies in Tel Aviv, the result of peace treaties which are searingly unpopular still. The Egyptian president who came to terms with Israel, Anwar Sadat, paid for it with his life, and the militant Islamist movement remains a constant threat to his authoritarian successor, Hosni Mubarak. In Jordan, Palestinian refugees and their descendants make up more than half the population. The regime of King Abdullah, benign and tolerant by regional standards, lives in the perpetual twin shadows cast by Saddam Hussain to the east, and simmering unrest among the refugees. That is why both Egypt and Jordan are discreetly nudging Yasser Arafat towards a peace settlement, with as much honour as he can retain. But Arafat too must take acount of his own 2m subjects in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank. More than 300 Palestinians have died since the end of September, and countless thousands have been wounded. Most live in squalor, and their misery has been compounded by Israel's strict military blockade. If their leader comes to terms with Israel now, he cannot expect to retain their devotion, which has been remarkably constant through seven years of uncertainty and sacrifice. The blockade of the Palestinian territories is also, oddly enough, one of the main reasons for Israel to redouble its efforts for peace. The country's economy, which grew last year by an impressive 5.9%, has been hammered by the sudden unavailability of cheap Palestinian labour, particularly in the agriculture and construction industries. But Ehud Barak's main motivation for one last tilt at peace is that he needs a deal desperately if he is to have any chance of holding on to his job. Israelis go to the polls on February 6 to choose their prime minister. As things now miserably stand, they will go for the fire-breathing rightwing challenger, Ariel Sharon. Sharon, who has threatened to bomb the Palestinians of the occupied territories into submission, is by far the Arabs' most hated Israeli. His election as prime minister would be seen widely in the region as a declaration of that war which until now has been only a talking point.

world/2001/apr/07/israel1,Israel: The dove patrolling on the hawk's wing,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/07/israel1,"The Israeli foreign minister and Nobel peace laureate Shimon Peres is unapologetic that, having devoted so much of his life to the pursuit of peace, he has entered into a partnership with Ariel Sharon. The partnership is only a month old, and the question that will come to dominate Israeli and Palestinian politics is how long the dove and hawk can work together. In an interview with the Guardian he justified his presence in the cabinet on the grounds that by being there he could exert a moderating influence on Mr Sharon. ""I think I can be effective,"" he said. ""I am not there to add water to the soup. Sharon knows my views and I have not changed."" Regardless of the increasing violence, much of it being inflicted by his own government, Mr Peres is optimistic about the chance of peace. When serious negotiations eventually began in the Middle East, he said, ""You will be surprised how fast it [peace and economic growth] can be."" Throughout a blood-stained career Mr Sharon's instinct has been to resort to force, and events since he became prime minister a month ago suggest that little has changed. Mr Peres disputed this. ""I have known Sharon for 50 years. We did not agree politically, but we kept on a personal relationship. It is the first time he is becoming prime minister. I do not think he would like to wind up his term as prime minister having the country in flame and blood."" Had Mr Sharon changed? ""I think the situation has changed. I think also that age does not necessarily have a negative impact on people. Arafat, Sharon and myself are together 232 years. It is a lot of time. It must have some promise of wisdom and experience."" While Mr Sharon punishes the Palestinians with an economic blockade, rocket attacks and assassinations, it is Mr Peres's job to be the acceptable international face of the government and to open channels to the Palestinians. Symbols of peace If Mr Sharon allows it, it will be through Mr Peres that peace negotiations will eventually resume. He met his Palestinian counterpart in Athens on Wednesday, the first high-level contact between the two sides since Mr Sharon took office. ""After a long interruption, the mere meeting was a departure from the monopoly of guns,"" he said. Mr Peres's office in a high-rise block in Tel Aviv is filled with symbols of peace: statues of women holding doves and olive branches; a buddha; and, in the most prominent spot of all, a blow-up of him signing the Oslo peace accord in 1993 with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. Mr Sharon described Oslo as appeasement. Mr Peres plays down the insult. ""Politicians have a collection of so many expressions, some of them right, some of them wrong. I think this expression is a wrong expression."" Had it been vanity, at the age of 77, to seek power one more time? He replied: ""I am sure the person who said it is free of vanity."" But he added: ""It is not a competition of beauty, not even a competition of politicians. It is a very serious situation. If I shall be immodest - you can call it vanity - I will put whatever experience I have to use in order to reopen negotiations. I do not believe the problems can be resolved by force."" Mr Peres spoke to the third of the ageing trio, Mr Arafat, by phone a few weeks ago, and he remains in touch through intermediaries, but they have not yet met since he became foreign minister. Mr Sharon has called Mr Arafat a terrorist, and the interior minister, Uzi Landau, called him a war criminal yesterday. But Mr Peres said: ""We know each other quite well and we are very careful not to turn a disagreement into an insult."" He had no such qualms about insulting the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, the London-trained ophthalmologist who replaced his father as president last year and last month likened Israel in its treatment of the Palestinians to the Nazis. Until last year Israel was hoping to negotiate a peace deal with Syria, but Mr Peres confirmed that there was little chance of pursuing that track in the near future. ""I am not saying it has no future, but there is no present,"" he said. ""Bashar looks like he studied ophthalmology in London, but his vision is even more short-sighted than his father's. To make a speech comparing Israel to the Nazis! For that, believe me, you should not waste your time in London."" Step by step In his talks with the Palestinians in Athens, Mr Peres made it clear that he favoured an interim agreement, a step by step approach, rather than the all-embracing one that the previous prime minister, Ehud Barak, was seeking. He offered to relax the economic embargo on the Palestinian territories in return for their cooperation in reducing violence. His vision is the creation of a vibrant economy in the Middle East embracing Israel and its Arab neighbours The Palestinians pressed for international observers, from the UN or the EU, to give protection from Israeli soldiers and settlers. Mr Peres was scathing. ""We have doubts about what these observers will do. Will they be allowed to visit the clandestine headquarters of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hizbullah to see where the terror is being originated?"" The only other peace plan around at present, put to the White House this week, is an initiative by Egypt and Jordan. Mr Peres ruled out any progress in that direction. It was, he said, aimed at trying to put back on the table the final offer made this year by Mr Barak and Bill Clinton, an offer Mr Arafat had rejected. ""Once rejected, they no longer exist,"" Mr Peres said. Did he rule out Israel simply leaving the West Bank and Gaza, an option considered but discarded by the previous government? ""The borders are very complicated. Time didn't stand still and what once was two eggs is now omelettes, which are hard to divide and organise."" There were other problems: the future of Jerusalem, the fate of the Palestinian refugees and the issue of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. He said he had extracted a promise from Mr Sharon that there would be no new settlements, though it was announced on Thursday that existing ones would be expanded, which, to the Palestinians, is just as bad. France and the US condemned the plan as inflammatory. But although most Israelis accept that eventually many settlers will have to leave the West Bank, Mr Peres refused to concede the point. ""The problem is not the settlements but the people who reside there. Take Hebron: there are 170,000 Palestinians and 400 Israelis. Why can't they live in peace? It is a matter of relations, not locations."" In Israel, he said, there were 6m Israelis and 1m Arabs: the implication being that they had learned to co-exist. He rejected the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their former homes, saying it would mean the end of Israel, and he ruled out an apology for their loss of land. ""Why should Israel apologise? There was a Jewish quarter in Hebron in 1929. Most of them were assassinated in cold blood. You cannot pave history with apologies."" He added: ""I think people who are busy with the future should not think of the past: it is so full of so many errors. History is a chain of errors. We have to concentrate on the history of the future, not the history of the past.""

world/2001/jan/14/israel,Traitor executed after betraying cousin to Israel,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/14/israel,"Yesterday it was Alam Bani Odeh's turn to die, marched before a firing squad of six Palestinian security officers in a crowded public square in Nablus on the West Bank, sentenced to death for collaborating with Israel's secret services in murder. Cowed and frightened, head bowed and hands cuffed before him, officers of the Palestinian Authority took Bani Odeh's arms and bustled him into a car for his short, final journey to a stake hammered into the centre of a nearby square. A slight man with a young and fleshy face, his lip covered by a sparse moustache, he could have been dressed for a family outing in a T-shirt and windcheater. But his T-shirt betrayed his destination: a red dot had been painted above his heart to help the marksmen kill him. Once in the square they tied him to the stake and covered his head. Moments later a line of police formed up and fired into his body, ending the life of a man accused of the most serious crime imaginable in the Palestinian Territories today: fingering a fellow Palestinian for assassination for $2,000. As the shots rang out across the town, a crowd of thousands who had gathered for the killing shouted: 'God is great!' Afterwards friends and relatives of the 25-year-old revealed that in his last hours, as he waited to be shot, the young man had sat weeping, holding his three-year-old daughter's hand. Alam Bani Odeh was not alone in going before firing squad of his own people yesterday morning in the first public executions of collaborators in the present intifada. In Gaza City too a similarly brutal scene was being played out as Majdi Mikkawi, 28, convicted for his part in the killing by Israeli forces of a senior Fatah official and several of his fighters near Gaza, was also put to death. The executions - both ratified by Yasser Arafat - took place hours before negotiators from both sides were due to resume the search for peace. Alam's crime was as serious as could be committed in the Palestinian communities of the West Bank. According to the court that convicted him, Alam sold his distant cousin Ibrahim to an Israeli hit squad for $2,000. Ibrahim had been a senior Hamas leader in Nablus, a veteran of Afghanistan and an accomplished bomb maker, locked up before the current intifada by Arafat's own men. But as the intifada death toll crept up, the Palestinian leader ordered the release of men like Ibrahim to help the cause. And when Ibrahim was freed it was Alam who was waiting to drive him. Alam led him to the car that the Israeli secret services had booby-trapped. A headrest packed with explosives was detonated from a helicopter, decapitating him. The story of Majdi Makawi, 28, is similar in many details. It is the story of another man who sold out a relative - Jamal Abdel Razek, a leader of Arafat's Fatah movement - to the Israelis. Razek, a Fatah commander in the southern Gazan town of Rafah, died in November when Israeli soldiers opened fire on two cars at a checkpoint, killing him and three other people who Israel said were also militia members. The recruitment of Alam Bani Odeh and Majdi Mikkawi sent a chill of fear through the leadership of the Palestinian intifada. It confirmed their worst suspicions. Not only had Shin Bet, Israel's secret services, infiltrated the families of Fatah and Hamas leaders but it was using these agents to provide intelligence for their assassination. It is a claim that the Israelis have not denied, faced with evidence of a shoot-to-kill policy that has claimed the lives of almost a dozen senior Palestinian lead ers. Israeli officials have confirmed some such hits, and defend the practice overall, not least the hits carried out by the elite Kingfisher unit. What is without doubt is that Israel's security services have infiltrated the Palestinian Authority at every level, among them Israeli agents from Duvdevan, the elite undercover unit that trains Israelis to pass as Arabs so they can operate in secret on the West Bank. And no one - least of all the Palestinians - is surprised that many of their neighbours are working for the Israelis. During the previous intifada - and in the years of violence that preceded it - Israel recruited thousands of agents to inform on militants in the community. Some, Israeli Arabs in specialist units, worked undercover in Palestinian towns or were employed in snatch squads. Others were Palestinians who were corrupted with the offer of money or the chance to settle family feuds. Indeed, when Israel handed over police stations and army posts to the nascent Palestinian Authority after the Oslo peace accords, the new occupants discovered the offices were riddled with Israeli listening devices, some booby-trapped. The identity of Israel's Arab collaborators has become the stuff of fierce contention during the last few months. In the current paranoia even some the most senior of Arafat's lieutenants have been named by gossips on the streets. Bani Odeh, however, was small fry, recruited 18 months before the killing of his cousin, long before the intifada had even begun. But faced with warnings of possible conflict, the Israeli secret services were already placing extra agents on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. As the intifada intensified, and they were warned that Ibrahim Bani Odeh was about to be released, they summoned his cousin to a meeting, asking him to bring his car. The Palestinian allowed the Israelis to take the car, allegedly to plant a homing device. Instead they packed the headrest of the battered Subaru with high explosives, asking Alam to give Ibrahim the car. When the two men separated later that day, with Alam explaining he would hitchhike to a nearby town, Israeli agents blew his cousin's head off. 'People remember executions,' Ghassan Khader, a witness to the execution of Bani Odeh, said last night. 'The people were very happy. They say that he deserved it. When Bani Odeh fell to the ground, the crowd were shouting and cheering.' He added that most of those who went to witness the Nablus execution felt that measures like this would deter collaborators. In Gaza too the executions were greeted with satisfaction. The mother of Awni Dheir, one of the four Fatah members killed in the incident in which Mikkawi was implicated, expressed joy over his execution. 'These are tears of joy,' she said. 'I felt comforted to hear the bullets and to see the execution has really taken place. I thank President Yasser Arafat.' Bani Odeh and Mikkawi will not be the last to die. Last night a court in the West Bank town of Bethlehem convicted four other Palestinians as collaborators in the November killing of militia commander Hussein Abayat, sentencing two of them to death.",2001-01-14T00:08:14Z,"{'polarity': 0.03868117797695263, 'subjectivity': 0.4138903115663677}",0.4138903115663677
world/2001/jun/26/balkans,Christopher Hope revisits the Balkans,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/26/balkans,"When I made my first visit to Belgrade, as a guest of the British Council about 10 years ago, there was a man in the Kneza Mihaila, that central boulevard where all Belgrade comes to promenade, and to protest. He was still there last week. You step on to his big pink scale, he slides the bolt beneath your chin and reads off your weight. He's a big man: his belly touches the back of the scale. And this is a relief. Just about every time I've been back to Yugoslavia in past years there has been less of it to see. It is the incredible shrinking man of Europe. Could it have been otherwise? Ex-Yugoslavia is a morality play in four wars. It puts an old question with grim relish: can different tribes with different faiths inhabit the same territory in peace? On the evidence so far the answer is no. What had been, like the man with the pink weighing machine, a generous, varied country of 22m people, living in six republics (and two self-governing regions, a place called Vojvodina and a place no one had heard of called Kosovo), held together by a big fat chap called Tito, suddenly blew itself to smithereens. What lit the fuse? When exactly did Yugoslavia go round the bend? Choose your combustible moment. I'd say it was in the last week of June 1991. That is when Slovenia and Croatia walked out of the federal assembly in Belgrade and declared themselves independent. The wars of secession began almost immediately. Then Bosnia-Herzegovina collapsed into war, Macedonia did a runner, and Kosovo caught fire and is still burning. Ten years on that leaves just Montenegro, with Serbia, in a federation of two. ""Montenegro, Ecological State"", proclaims the fading propaganda in Belgrade bookshop windows. Another sentimental delusion - it has one of the filthiest coastlines on the Adriatic. If Montenegro separates Serbia will be alone in a federation of one. ""Let it go,"" said the Belgrade publisher Zoran Hamovic. ""Yugoslavia is like an old sock that must unravel. First we have the divorce, maybe later the remarriage."" When I first came here, Slobodan Milosevic was recently in power. Now he is in prison. Belgrade has changed since Milosevic fell. Gone are the swaggering certainties. Belgrade is punch-drunk, excoriated by critics, boycotted by much of the world, and bombed by Nato. It doesn't know where it is. That is hardly surprising. ""Zagreb - this way"", say the motorway signs - but it's a bad joke. ""Kosovo - that way"", say the maps, and it really isn't kind. What you get in Belgrade now is the view from the amputation couch. Like a man who has lost several limbs, Serbia still feels phantom attachments - but when the patient tries to walk he keeps falling over. There is also this strange amnesia; as if time has raced Serbs away from the way things were, and they cannot bear to think about grey yesterday, or the wars, or Milosevic. But yesterday won't go away. The graves of victims murdered in Kosovo are turning up on the doorsteps of Belgrade, the ghosts are walking. I stayed at the Hyatt, then and now. There are two international hotels in new Belgrade, across the Sava River, reached by the bridge Nato didn't bomb because lots of people stood on it every night with targets pasted to their foreheads. It was a short walk to the smashed Chinese embassy, now overrun by weeds. Nato bombed it because the CIA got the ""wrong"" address. What they call the ""Sorry, wrong number"" bombing. It was a mistake that has had unexpected effects as far away as Sarajevo. It must have come as a relief to Belgrade high society that Nato did not bomb the foreign hotels. Their public rooms were always much in demand for weddings and assassinations. It was in the Hyatt that the patriot and gangster known as ""Knele"", Aleksandar Knezevic, was gunned down 1992. It was an occasion few will forget. At the Intercontinental across the way, a one-time pastry cook called Zeljko Raznatovic, otherwise known as Arkan - whose death-squads terrified Bosnians, and quite a few Serbs - was murdered. In Milosevic's Belgrade, criminality and celebrity merged. Politics moved from Marxism to mystic nationalism (usually about blood and soil, flags and fatherland) to mafiadom (usually about oil or cigarettes or guns). It is a pattern that Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia are emulating. I wanted to begin my Yugoslav travels where I began some 10 years ago - in Novi Sad, the Hungarian ghost of central Serbia; and to end them in Kosovo, the Albanian enclave. It's easier said than done. In the early 90s, when the Balkan wars were breaking out, I came to Novi Sad by train from Vienna, and we were warned to sleep with our heads away from the doors because Hungarian highwaymen leaped aboard in the night and stole whatever they could lay their hands on. Heady times. You could be offered hand grenades in Novi Sad market. In Novi Sad the bridges over the Danube were still down. It was June 10 - two years to the day since the Nato bombs stopped falling. Traffic is blocked on the river and there is not much inclination to fix things. In an odd way it was a good sign. Despite their reputation as fighters, wars are not what Serbs do best, and the last four have been disastrous. So the bargaining has started. If countries upriver want the Danube opened, let them pay for it. If the west wants Milosevic in the Hague, it had better stump up. There are other signs of a shift. Sremski Karlovci, not far from Novi Sad, blends Orthodox Serbian buildings and the opulent ochre of the Austro-Hungarian empire to which the little town once belonged. Sremski Karlovci is in gentle ruin. The lead sheeting is slipping from the cupola of the wonderful old theology building, there is a stork nesting in the chimney. Zoran Hamovic has plans for its revival. He wants to take the old town hall and turn it into Translation City, a home from home for interpreters and translators who use and teach the Balkan languages - Serbian, Croatian, Greek, Albanian, Romanian. Before the Balkan wars, Serbs and Croats spoke the same language, though they would deny it now. Since the wars began, they have been inventing new words and compiling new dictionaries to prove that Serbo-Croat was a gigantic plot by the former Tito regime. And anyway, they can't think of what to say to one another. Hamovic holds that it is useful to talk to your neighbours, and desirable for them to talk back. He wants to encourage it. Anywhere else this might seem a pretty modest proposal, but in ex-Yugoslavia, where they haven't spoken in years, it is an idea of almost demented good sense. I took the Vienna express from Belgrade to Croatia. It is about a six-hour journey to Zagreb, the Croatian capital. In a delightful old custom from Austro-Hungarian times, the station master appears at his front door and stiffens to attention as the express slides by. You learn to make the most of delightful customs in the Balkans. When the domes of the Serbian Orthodox churches give way to the pointy-hat steeples of Catholic Croatia, the fun is over. The train stops at the Serbian border and sits in no man's land for about an hour. Serbian police officers come aboard, documents are requested, scrutinised, checked by walkie-talkie. Then the train inches forward to the Croatian border, sighs, stops, and it all happens again. Change your money, your head, your religion, your language - and the locomotive. I first saw Zagreb in the spring of 1992, when Croatians fought Serbs in southern and eastern Croatia. You drove down the motorway and turned left for the front lines. In a town called Karlovac, Croat forces faced Croatian Serbs in a war at the end of the motorway. Small polite notices stuck on street corners said ""Mine"". The military base had been burnt and abandoned by the Yugoslav national army. Inside a great hangar were lines of blackened tanks. An officer of the Croatian militia protested to me that the Yugoslav national army was using cluster bombs, supplied - or at least built - by Britain. In Croatia I saw for the first time the blend of domesticity and brutality that marked the Balkan wars. Wars fought in the suburbs, in the meadows. Wars where the sniper would hide in the belfry of the pretty church, where a hospital was raked with fire because it was a hospital, where an old man went on scything a meadow as the shells came in. Wars where tanks were used to blast away the fronts of houses and leave the curtains swinging in the wind, leave untouched the sofa and the children's photos on the wall, leave empty and nameless a place that had been someone's home until a shell sheared off its face. One day in 1992 I saw my first Croatian rally. I was in the great space in front of Zagreb station, King Tomislav Square. It was full of boots, badges, flags and bands. The Croatian leader, Franjo Tudjman, was to speak to his followers - which meant just about everybody, because if you weren't a follower you were an enemy. It was a nationalist fiesta, with songs and symbols and an angry unabashed nostalgia for Croatia's fascist Ustase past, its collaboration with Nazi Germany. There was a swirling baroque intoxication that took me as close I will ever get to something of the atmosphere that must have prevailed at Mussolini's rallies. After the rally, I sat in the Zagreb Pen Club and heard the chairman make a grovelling apology for some wretched scribbler who had dared to criticise Tudjman's new regime - and no one turned a hair. The Croats of Zagreb said it was ""democracy"". They said so loudly, and if you didn't agree they shouted and waved their fists. Their distress was understandable. Dubrovnik was under fire from the Serb navy, and large parts of eastern Croatia, in the Krajina, were in the hands of Croatian Serbs. A fellow writer put it this way: ""For us Croats, the old Federation of Yugoslavia is a lost ideal. Unfortunately, for the Serbs, it is lost property."" It turned out a few years later that the Croats also felt pretty strongly about lost property. In 1995 they assembled their armies, bought lots of weapons from Argentina, attacked the Krajina Serbs and drove them out in their tens of thousands to refugee camps in Serbia where they live today. Cleanse or be cleansed? Victor or victim? These are very Balkan questions. Who will be which today? What a difference 10 years makes. I was back in Zagreb. No more marching bands, no more of the nationalist tat they used to flog. Everyone is feeling a lot better, they have mobile phones, and all the right brands are in all the shopping centres. Narrow your eyes and you might be - in Europe. A vintage sound truck belting out rap crossed an empty King Tomislav Square, flying the Croat chequered flag. I don't much like Croatian rap, but it beats the Nuremberg melodies they were playing last time round. The Croats have set out to reinvent themselves. They've traded Tudjman for the Teletubbies, who beam at you from the new shopping centres; they've swapped their Ustase past for a European future. They've rebranded themselves as cuddly creatures, the koala bears of the Balkans. Gone are the fists and the neo-fascist nostalgia with its flags and badges. Gone are the war cries. Gone too are 165,000 Krajina Serbs. From Zagreb I took the train to Slovenia. Ten years ago the Slovenes fought the Yugoslav national army and won - in under a fortnight. I suspect that the victory was as much to their own surprise as anyone else's, and Vuk Draskovic, the Serb writer and politician who was slung into jail by the Milosevic regime, spoke for many when he said the Yugoslav national army had been humiliated in tiny Slovenia by what he called ""a gang with lime-tree leaves in their hats"". I got to Slovenia in April 1992, shortly after that lime-tree leaf war, and I remember it as a most vivid example of instant tribalism; just add gunpowder and stir. The bullets had barely stopped flying and Slovenia was hacking out a border with Croatia. The border between Croatia and Slovenia consisted of two men in baseball caps, under a Marlboro umbrella; they called themselves ""customs"" and demanded deutschmarks for a ""visa"" fee, a request backed by soldiers. Today the Slovenian border is permanent, its officials wear spanking Slovenian uniforms and you must change your Croatian money for Slovenian money. Slovenia is strawberries and snowy peaks, yoghurt and yodelling. If Croatia these days is in the business of impersonating a democracy, Slovenia makes a living by giving impressions of other countries. It will do you a convincing Switzerland, or a passable Austria. Slovenia expects to be admitted to the EU any time now. After cutting itself off from the ex-Yugoslav federation, it can't wait to attach itself to another large federal body. And that perhaps explains why, for all its prosperity, there is something twitchy about Slovenia. It has all the eerie animation of a severed limb. The little capital, Ljubljana, was being spruced up for the visits of the US and Russian presidents, George Bush and Vladimir Putin. The T-shirts read ""I was in Ljubljana for the George and Vladimir Show!"" Bush and Putin met in Brdo Castle, once the winter palace of the Serb prince Karadjordjevic. Whoever writes the script in Yugoslavia has a baleful wit. I wanted to go on to Sarajevo from Slovenia. Last time I was in Bosnia I travelled by road. This time I had to fly. Bosnia-Herzegovina is less than an hour by air from Slovenia, but it is several lifetimes removed by any other measure. On that first trip by road, in 1992, I went first to Montenegro and stopped at a monastery. Outside, army trucks were rumbling up the road to Sarajevo. In the monastery garden, over coffee and honey and plum brandy, I asked the abbot: ""Do you think it is right for a Christian to live with hate in his heart?"" He thought for a moment and then he said: ""No. But the other side is worse."" Flying into Sarajevo again, I looked for the television tower. I remember the shells landing nearby and the way it trembled like a flower - massive means to produce such eerily delicate effects. I remember that the casualties of these wars had nothing of Hollywood colour; they seemed alarmingly forlorn, weightless, crumpled like so much scrap paper. The shooting has stopped in Sarajevo; the sadness remains. Svjetlana Nedimovic and Tarik Jusic are two young Bosnians who keep an eye on what the press and radio are saying, who analyse language, who talk witheringly of the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and their buzzwords - for NGOs drive hard bargains in their steely, gentle way. Those who take their noble shilling are expected to produce evidence that benevolence works, that Bosnians are improving; the NGOs want value for money, they desire concrete signs of ""multiculturalism"", ""democratisation"", ""civil society"" and the big one - ""inter-ethnicity"". But this is Bosnia, and what they get is division, rancour, clannishness and cleansing. And Bosnia, like other places in the incredibly shrinking Balkans, goes on shrinking. There are few Serbs left in Sarajevo, Tarik says: perhaps 80,000 have left since 1991. And it is not just the Serbs. The young, the bright, the desperate, are also going. ""Have a look at the Austrian embassy,"" said Jusic. I did. The waves of people besieging the embassy give the place the look of some ghastly street party. They haven't come to be multicultural, they do not wish to democratise; they are ready to storm the exits. It isn't the happiest thing, losing your young to the diaspora. And the politicians of Bosnia, it would seem, are not into inter-ethnicity. They prefer power - theirs. No one much cares to step out of line. To question, to disobey, says Nedimovic, is to take a risk. They do not do it in the political parties, intent on retaining power, or in the universities, where those in charge believe that to question is to betray. The poker players of Bosnia are power freaks. They jumped from Tito's communism to nationalism to NGO-dom, and none of it counts - what counts is a gun stuck in your ear. The mood is nicely caught by Angelina Simic, writing in the English paper the Bosnia Daily: ""If I do not control, I do not exist."" Sarajevo, once a city of many sorts of people, of intermarriage and religious richness, is now a tightly constrained, heavily subsidised ghetto. But it's not all purity in Sarajevo, not at all. And this is where that far-away bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade has the most peculiar results. It led to an ever-closer expression of solidarity between Belgrade and the Chinese government, and it led to Milosevic opening his doors to many Chinese visitors wishing to extend their European horizons. The Chinese connection runs from Belgrade, down through Serbia's unlovely stepchild in Bosnia, the Republika Srpska. And from there, more and more Chinese are showing up in Sarajevo. And they haven't come to open restaurants. In some of the roughest suburbs in Sarajevo, said Nedimovic, where the locals don't scare easily, people who survived the war are suddenly terrified. It's the downside of ethnic cleansing. You've just got rid of a lot of alien Serbs and look who moved in next door... Nedimovic keeps a straight face. The feeling, she says, is that Gypsies are bad enough - now it's the Chinese! ""Any minute they'll take over."" In the Balkans, the way forward is often backwards. I flew back to Ljubljana in order to fly forward to Skopje, the capital of Macedonia. Rebel Albanian fighters in the hills had shelled bits of the city and were threatening to hit the airport. Thousands of refugees were on the road to Kosovo. The Museum of Contemporary Art opened a new electronic show about the human genome and gene manipulation. It was an eerie evening. The museum sits on a hill and makes a good target; for this reason the computerised exhibits and their all-too-human creators were ringed by soldiers. Inside the museum were advanced computing machines. Outside the museum, the gardens were full of soldiers with advanced weapons. And somewhere in the middle were some human beings. No one knew who the men with the mortars a few miles outside the city really were. Macedonian Albanians? Kosovo Albanians? Albanian Albanians? Terrorists, extremists, patriots, mercenaries or plain criminals? A taxi driver called Ahmed offered to take me to Tetovo, where there was fighting. ""We could ask who they are,"" said Ahmed. Then he said, ""It will cost you 40 German marks."" We drove for a time; there were lots of Macedonian troops, and Ahmed said: ""What happens if I get shot?"" I must have looked puzzled. ""I mean, what happens to the 40 marks?"" said Ahmed. We were turned away by Macedonian troops before we reached Tetovo. They did not know who they were fighting. They asked me to tell them if I found out. I didn't. Nobody knows. But there are two things that everyone in Skopje - Macedonian or Albanian - does know and says repeatedly: ""Our politicians, all of them, are useless,"" and, ""We don't want a war. Please let someone make sure there is not a war."" The only ""someone"" able to stop a war is Nato. The Macedonians see it this way: there is Sfor in Bosnia, and Kfor in Kosovo - surely the time of Mfor is near? They may be right. If it happens then a great stretch of southern Europe will be frozen uneasily, not into peace but into a kind of paralysis: a condition sufficient to prevent the patient from murdering his neighbours, but not enough to stop the mafias who feast on the pain of the Balkans from preying on the weak and the frightened. I drove from Skopje into Kosovo, along the route the refugees take, mostly ""good"" Macedonians fleeing the ""bad"" Albanian militias. Moral labels are as shifting as Balkan currencies, as shifting as the ground in this earthquake zone, as shifting as the promises of local politicians, and the well-meaning bluster of western friends. There is a Greek unit of UN troops installed at the crossing point into Kosovo. They park armoured cars in the gardens of the few surviving Serbian Orthodox churches. In the beastly game they play in the Balkans, wrecking your enemies' places of worship, even his graveyards, wins points - and points in the Balkans mean territory. Serbs destroyed many Kosovan mosques; now Kosovans are doing the same to Serb churches. A great gulf in perception opens between agencies such as the UN, who are here for reconstruction, and local victors, who are here for revenge. One of the splashes of colour on the baking hillsides as you approach the capital, Pristina, is the Kosovo Liberation Army graveyard, rosy with red flags and wreaths. I was here last in 1992, when sanctions against Serbia were biting. There were electricity cuts. The Grand Hotel had lost the last two letters of its name and the big neon sign on the roof read ""Grand Hot"". It is as gloomy as ever. Big banners over the main road proclaim ""Pristina - European City"". Another word favoured on the banners is ""transparent"". I don't believe it. Nowhere is less transparent than Pristina. Pristina is as opaque as ever. The monthly wage - when you can talk in such nonsensical terms - is maybe 60 or 70 deutschmarks (£19-22). For they reckon everything in deutschmarks in Pristina, as they do across ex-Yugoslavia. It is the true currency of the Balkans; everything else is paper. And Kosovo takes only cash. Pristina doesn't have a bank worth the name, nor a cash machine; it takes no cheques, it has no credit cards, but it does have a few posters up preparing people in this cash economy for the arrival of the euro early next year. For what talks in Pristina is money and muscle, mixed in a black economy. Along the dusty sidewalks, young men are hawking cigarettes, CDs and sunglasses. The cash comes from the troops and bureaucrats, the new occupying forces of Nato and the UN, who have Kosovo in their benevolent bear-hug. You see them sitting in places such as John's Kukri bar (its emblem is two crooked knives and the UN laurel leaves - war and peace). It is a couple of doors down from the Princess Di sandwich shop. Tall men, well-fed, rich by Kosovo standards, who drive around in fleets of four-wheel drives, sit over a beer watching the nubile flesh perambulating by on platform heels. On the streets, the boys hawking bootleg software and CDs are also selling their sisters. There was a notion, useful while it lasted, that Serbs were nasty but Albanian Kosovans were nice. But this is the Balkans, and no one is nice. When they occupied Kosovo, the Serbs drove out hundreds of thousand of Albanian Kosovans. When Belgrade capitulated after the Nato bombing, the Kosovan Albanians returned and the Serbs fled. For good measure, the Kosovan Albanians drove out the Gypsies, accusing them of being ""collaborators"". It is thought there were 100,000 in Kosovo before the conflict began; about 8,000 remain. I flew out of Pristina airport as the other half of the George and Vladimir show flew in. President Putin had come to present medals to the Russian troops who beat Nato to Pristina airport. I left with a group of visiting Americans. Cordial Christians they were, and one of them was wearing a ""Prayer of Jabez"" T-shirt. ""And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying: 'O that You would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory...' "" The prayer of Jabez has been heard in Kosovo, and it is heard in Macedonia, where the rebels in the hills find that what it takes to enlarge your territory are some mortars; with a couple of burned-out villages you can carve out a little bit of the country and make it all your own. And if one day you add it to existing Albania, you could end up with something called ""Greater Albania"". That's a phrase you hear a lot in Macedonia and Kosovo, in much the same way as people used to talk of Greater Serbia when the Serbs were praying the prayer of Jabez. To get back to Belgrade from Pristina I had to fly via Vienna - more or less the route once preferred by the Ottoman Turks when conquering this part of the Balkans. What would Tito have made of it all, I wonder? No one mentions Tito's name except to invoke it as the embodiment of some Machiavellian master-spirit, a baleful enigma.He was, they say, an illusionist - Yugoslavia was held together by a dexterous dictator, a brutal dreamer. It was a trick, a sham, an unworkable paradox. Maybe the view of the old magician is shifting: among the banners of the many marches against Milosevic, my favourite read: ""Tito come home - all is forgiven.""

world/2001/may/06/nelsonmandela.featuresreview,Trafalgar's new Nelson,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/06/nelsonmandela.featuresreview,"'He's here, he's here.' The word goes round the crowded balcony at South Africa House. A moment earlier, all attention was on the astonishing spectacle below: Trafalgar Square closed off, a stage built over the fountain, the Landseer lions now serving as the set for a pop concert, 30,000 people swaying, dancing, cheering. A light drizzle makes the scene quintessentially English. Pigeons lift into the air on each clap of percussion. Up on our balcony, Ken Livingstone watches them grimly. Barbara Castle is on a chair, hunched under an umbrella. The great and the good are squashed together up here: Lord Attenborough, Baronesses Amos and Chalker, Greg Dyke, Paul Boateng, Charles Kennedy, Bill Morris, Peter Mandelson. My gaze is fixed on one short figure leaning on the parapet. Ethel de Keyser, who ran Anti-Apartheid, then the British Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa (BDAF), now the Canon Collins Trust. She stares down at the square with a tired but contented expression. Who would have thought she'd ever be drinking champagne in South Africa House? Or any of us. This was a building you viewed from the outside only, holding placards and banners, a grim fortress looming over Trafalgar Square. Yet tonight, it's a place of celebration. Incredible. You blink, you pinch yourself. Particularly now, as the symbol of this remarkable transformation arrives in the room behind us and starts towards the open door. 'He's here!' The High Commissioner, Cheryl Carolus, supports his arm. His walk is careful yet steady. He's wearing a hearing aid but it's clearly a good one for Cheryl is speaking to him quietly, warmly, as she introduces people. She uses the traditional term of respect to address him: 'Tata, please meet... and Tata, this is...' He beams at people. They smile back in a special way, as though a bulb has been switched on inside them. This radiant smile passes round the balcony with him. It's impossible not to think of religious imagery. Now it's our turn. I thought I'd be nervous but he's too peaceful a presence. 'Tata, this is Antony Sher and his partner, Greg Doran; they're doing the show for us at the Royal Festival Hall.' The show is a sequel to an event we helped organise at Sadler's Wells in 1988: Two Dogs and Freedom. The title was inspired by a remark made by a six-year-old boy in Soweto: 'When I am old I would like to have a wife and two children, a boy and a girl, and a big house, and two dogs and freedom.' It was just a one-off performance - an anti-apartheid fundraiser, a star-studded gala. Just one of those, yet it marked a big moment for me, the moment when I opened my eyes properly and saw - really saw - the place where I'd been born. During my childhood in the 1950s, Cape Town was a kind of paradise, a sinister paradise where you could have everything you wanted - sun, sea and plenty - as long as you didn't examine your surroundings too keenly. Don't gaze at that island, Robben Island, directly across from the pretty white beaches of Sea Point. Put on dark glasses, lie back in the glorious sunshine. Reach out for that chilled glass of wine, that platter of fresh crayfish. Don't glance at the hand that's serving you, don't worry who they are, what they're feeling. Just eat, drink, close your eyes. My grandparents fled anti-Semitic persecution in Eastern Europe at the turn of the century and ended up in South Africa. I sometimes wonder if God was playing a practical joke or testing them. You've been the underdog, you've been despised, but here's a different option. You can be the masters, others will be the servants. You can be safe, they'll be frightened and poor. That's the choice; now what will you do? Well, surprise surprise, they did nothing. A little cross on a ballot sheet - little effort, little commitment - and then that long, lovely lie in the sun. I didn't begin to wake up until I moved to London in 1968 to attend drama school. Suddenly, I was exposed to British papers, British TV and the recurring image of South Africa House surrounded by demonstrators. Suddenly I heard my country described as an evil place and its system of apartheid as an atrocity. Atrocity? That was a word I knew well. It featured in my readings on the pogroms and the Holocaust. Yet now it was being used about white South Africans. But, hang on a moment, that included my family; it included me. I quickly lost all trace of my accent. I told people I was British. I refused to visit home. I tried to hide who I was. Which you can't do, of course - you just implode. I needed liberating. And as the slogan goes: liberation equals education. Ethel de Keyser became my political guru and still is to this day. Sister of the freedom fighter Jack Tarshish, Ethel was then in charge of BDAF, which provided legal and educational fees for people in need back home. Short, dynamic, with wide, smiling almost Oriental features, Ethel was a tireless campaigner. From morning to night - smoking, clutching a cup of coffee, bustling round the BDAF offices - she found ways of raising money for her cause. People mostly said no to her. This was not a word she knew. Eventually they said yes. It was Ethel who approached me to help organise a gala for them in 1988. I said no. And then yes. For the first time I started meeting the group of South Africans exiled in London, white and black. In fact, it was the first time I was properly meeting any black South Africans. The poet Mongane Serote, the writer Mandla Langa, the musician Jonas Gangwa, his manager, Dali Tambo, the singer Ndonda Khuze. For one reason or another, they'd fled South Africa: Mandla's brother had been murdered by the police. Dali was the son of Oliver Tambo, president of the ANC, forced to operate in exile. All were yearning for home, yearning for the soil but not the system. They were tired, their skin quite grey from too many British winters. They smoked heavily. When they came along to meetings of the organising committee - and they didn't always (we were sometimes embarrassingly white) - they had a particular, distant look in their eyes. Here they were, joining in discussions about costumes and lighting, programmes and dressing-rooms; they really were very far away from home. They saw the humour in it. I liked that in them. Them. I'm talking like my family. Them - an arm's length word. Well, yes, no question. It was strange sitting round a table with them at last. I felt relief. Greg came onboard as director, and the documentary filmmaker Jon Blair recorded the event for Channel 4. Along with the performers already named, an eclectic cast included Bob Hoskins, Archbishop Trevor Huddle ston, Janet Suzman, Pieter Dirk-Uys, Rudolph Walker, the Kinnocks, Harold Pinter, Richard E. Grant, Richard Wilson, Stephen Fry and Spitting Image. I have two abiding memories of the evening. Images of two Jewish South Africans with very different experiences of their country. The first is of Albie Sachs walking onstage after the scene from David Edgar's Jail Diary of Albie Sachs to hug the actor who has just played him, Roger Rees. Albie can do neither thing easily, walk or hug; this is just seven months after the South African secret service car bomb in Maputo which tore off one arm, blinded one eye and damaged his balance. Yet he's smiling, lifting his good arm in celebration. The second memory is of myself during the final chorus of 'N'Kosi Sikele' . I'm towards the back of the huge cast, hoping that the C4 cameras can't find me. I'm crying, partly because of the impact of the show and partly because I don't yet know the words of this song, their song. The Sowetan boy whose words inspired Two Dogs and Freedom is 19 now. Has he got any of the items on his wish-list, I wonder? A wife? A house? Don't know, but he's certainly got the important one: freedom. In 1990, along with the rest of the world, I watched in wonder as one man walked out of prison and made a miracle happen: a peaceful transition from the Old to the New South Africa. It's the same man whose hand I'm shaking tonight on the balcony of South Africa House. Cheryl Carolus guides him into a side-room. Now Tony and Cherie Blair arrive, with their children, and Cheryl takes them into the room too. A tray with coffee, champagne, and South African snacks follows them in. Like a great actress, Cheryl has completely reinvented the role of diplomat. She's warm, funny, spontaneous, a terrific enthusiast. People fall in love within minutes of meeting her. I have only one complaint: like Ethel de Keyser, she doesn't understand the word no. When she invited Greg and me to do a follow-up to Two Dogs and Freedom we said absolutely not. Our schedules simply wouldn't allow it. Very flattered to be asked, but no. So here we are, doing Freedom Too! It'll be a benefit for the Canon Collins Trust. The distinguished South African director Janice Honeyman has come over to help stage the epic. Jazz legend Hugh Masekela is also flying in, as are the great singer, Sibongile Khumalo, the new stand-up whizz-kid, Marc Lottering, two leading actors, Sello Maake ka Ncube and James Ngcobo, and the unique dance group, Tswaragano. Several veterans of the last show are joining the ranks - Pieter-Dirk Uys, Janet Suzman, Richard E. Grant, Richard Wilson, the Kinnocks - as well as the Lion King company, which boasts a large South African contingent. We're part of the Celebrate South Africa festivities and although the evening will be upbeat in tone, it will also focus on some of the tougher issues in contemporary South Africa: Aids, crime, the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. On the balcony of South Africa House we all surge to the edge as a tremendous cheer fills the air. Below, the old man has walked onstage. He tries to speak but the people won't stop cheering. He beams at them, they smile back and Trafalgar Square lights up. My eyes fill. I'm glad to be here. In this building, in the centre of London. I feel at home. © Antony Sher 2001 Freedom Too! is at the Royal Festival Hall on 27 May.

society/2001/feb/13/asylum,Asylum policy could hit the sheltering scholars,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/feb/13/asylum,"Like most academics, Abdul Lalzad talks eagerly about his research. He is working on a way of using solar power to desalinate water cheaply - potentially a vast boon to his native Afghanistan and a swathe of countries across Asia, the Middle East and Africa which suffer from water shortages but no lack of sunshine. But as he talks at his bench at South Bank University in London his eyes betray deep anxiety and sadness. There is sadness for the wreck of his country under a regime which has driven him out and destroyed the university he was proud of. But uppermost in his mind is whether his wife and their five children will be allowed to join him after more than two years apart. They were being interviewed in Pakistan that day by the British High Commission about a visa. ""My mind is not here,"" he apologises. The professor of engineering from Kabul is one of 27 people now being helped by the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara), a body which started in 1933 to help Jews and other victims of the Nazi purge of universities. The formation of what was then called the Academic Assistance Council was kick-started by a tumultuous meeting at the Albert Hall addressed by Albert Einstein. Today the centres of persecution have shifted via South Africa and Latin America to Iraq, Sudan, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Somalia, but the job of helping university teachers and researchers to pick themselves up after persecution and establish themselves in this country remains the same. The climate of hatred and distrust of asylum seekers is perhaps even worse than in the 1930s, although over the years Britain's reward for sheltering scholars has been out of all proportion to the tiny investment - 18 Nobel prizewinners, 71 fellows of the Royal Society, 50 fellows of the British Academy. The council campaigns on refugee issues and criticises what it sees as the worst excesses of government policy, such as the demeaning vouchers system. Its president, Sir Raymond Hoffenberg, who himself was a political exile from South Africa, has attacked the ""wholly unacceptable"" Immigration and Asylum Act and the current wave of bigotry at a time of unprecedented prosperity: ""It is difficult to imagine the implications for the UK and the world had Karl Popper or Max Perutz - two of the scholars we supported - been dealt with in the demeaning way envisaged by the current legislation: in isolation from other scholars, dumped far from cen tres of learning and forced to live on benefits provided by vouchers."" But most of the council's work is practical: advice about the labyrinthine asylum and social security regulations, making contact with university departments where they might be welcome, small grants for fees and travel. Cara limits its scope to helping genuine academics but even for this small section of the overall refugee population it could do a lot more if it had more funds. Professor Lalzad's case is typical. A specialist in thermal engineering with a Russian masters degree, he taught in the department of mechanical engineering at Kabul University. He had five textbooks and more than 30 published articles to his credit and had held senior university positions. When the victorious Taliban closed the university, he worked for the Red Cross, in charge of distributing thousands of tonnes of food to 40,000 widows and disabled people. He was arrested, beaten with Kalashnikovs and thrown in prison on suspicion of giving information to anti-Taliban forces. The influence of the Red Cross got him released, but his life was in danger and he fled to Pakistan, where his wife and children were eventually able to follow. He arrived at Heathrow in December 1998, to be grilled for hours by immigration officials who believed he was Pakistani because his English was so good. (It was the medium of instruction in his department.) Lalzad concedes that Pakistanis do try to enter the UK by claiming to be Afghan refugees, and is sure he would have been deported had he not produced his Red Cross identity card. Then came a frustrating wait while his application for asylum was considered (it took 18 months) and he tried to get work. ""I felt ashamed sitting at home. It is a morally bad way of living for someone with education and knowledge not to work."" Letters to universities produced no result, though he was encouraged by a short course at the University of North London, where he made contacts. He was at last given a break at South Bank by the director of engineering research, Professor Tassos Karayiannis. A grant from Cara is paying bench fees and for the purchase of a computer as Lalzad pursues a part-time PhD on his desalination research. At the moment he is doing mathematical modelling with the aim of building an experimental model of a solar-powered desalination plant. Desalination technology is well advanced in the oil-rich Middle East states, but across a wide zone of northern Asia, the Middle East and North Africa there is a pressing need for small, cheap plants. The goal is a gadget consisting of a small box and a condenser. ""I hope it will be a very low cost and efficient technique for desalinating water that can be used in poor developing countries, especially where they have a lot of solar energy."" He hopes to be able to resume teaching at his new university. Meanwhile he waits for news of his family. The potential benefits of Professor Lalzad's research are obvious. John Akker, secretary of Cara, says his case is repeated many times over among the academics on their books. There is the Iraqi paediatrician, a consultant at Salahaddin University, forced to leave because of the help he gave to the Kurdish population. He has been given small grants for books and fees to enable him to pass the level of English that would allow him to practise in this country. Another Iraqi doctor is currently doing medical research at Manchester, while a bacteriologist identified only as Ms L is doing a PhD at Brighton University. Also receiving grants from the council are academics from Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda and Sierra Leon, and a Chinese economist who suffered long-running harassment and was dismissed from his university post after taking part in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. He is now doing an English course to enable him to pursue a masters. Until the council paid for travel expenses (£697 last year) he was walking ten miles to college. Yet he has not left all harassment behind: now it's racial. Akker is angered by current hysteria against asylum seekers, and worried by Home Secretary Jack Straw's proposals to process applications in neighbouring countries: ""These people are seen as scroungers living off the state, but they want to contribute here actively, and want to go back to their countries to change the things that brought them here in the first place."" Cara: giving hope when hope has fled Albie Sachs, an academic who became a judge in South Africa's constitutional court, was twice helped by Cara's predecessor body, the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning - once when he fled the apartheid regime in 1966 and then again when he was nearly killed by a bomb in Mozambique. In a lecture he expressed his warm feelings for the body and its quiet unobtrusive work. ""It is not one of those bodies which takes out adverts in the bottom right hand of the front page of the Guardian,"" he told his audience in London in 1997. ""It was people helping people in need simply because they were in trouble, because they got into trouble because they were trying to do research in an intolerant society where persecution became the name of the game."" This altruism did have enormous benefits to Britain in the contributions these outsiders made in teaching and research, and the effects did not stop there, he said. ""When the causes of persecution have been removed and we go back to our countries, we take so much of Britain with us. The positive and negative lessons which we learnt here. The things to avoid, the mistakes that are made, the good things that are done, and we help to rebuild our own countries and to develop democracy, science and learning and culture."" Sachs listed a series of ministers in the first post-apartheid government in South Africa who had spent time in Britain, from Thabo Mbeki, Nelson Mandela's successor, who has an MA in economics from Sussex, to finance minister Gill Marcus, who set up a sandwich kiosk in Holborn, London, while in exile, and Frene Ginwala, speaker of the South African parliament. There might be spin-offs for Britain, he added, ""but what really matters is that some things are good in themselves, they do not need extra justification.""

world/2001/feb/07/israel2,A warrior returns professing peace,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/07/israel2,"Ariel Sharon began his march to the prime minister's office on September 28 with an early morning jaunt to the most hallowed ground in Jerusalem's walled city. All the warning signs were there: peace talks with the Palestinians had collapsed over control of the site Muslims revere as the Haram al-Sharif and Jews as the Temple Mount. In the West Bank and Gaza, frustration with Israel's 33-year occupation was boiling over. Mr Sharon - nicknamed the Bulldozer - ploughed on. He climbed up to the disputed holy site in a phalanx of Israeli riot police. When the police staggered back down 45 minutes later, ducking chairs and rubbish bins hurled by Palestinian protesters, the intifada had begun. Four months and 380 deaths later, Israelis yesterday were set to entrust the old warhorse with guiding them out of the bloody mess he unleashed. In so doing, they are saying they no longer believe in peace with the Palestinians. If war is inevitable, they feel safer with a man who spent 50 years crushing Israel's enemies than with Ehud Barak, the prime minister who promised peace, but delivered a terrifying Palestinian uprising. In soft-focus campaign ads, which cast Mr Sharon, 72, as a kindly grandfather cuddling baby goats on his 1,000-acre farm, the rotund general insisted he wanted peace as badly as Mr Barak, who pursued negotiations to the last days of his prime ministership. Rosy rhetoric ""There have been attempts to divide Israel into those who want peace, and those who are opposed to peace. I want to say: we all want peace,"" he told his final campaign rally in the coastal city of Holon. ""In the army, I made life and death decisions, not just for me but for many men, and so I say I understand peace much better than many politicians."" But Mr Sharon has never explained his vision of peace, or how he can manage to reach a deal when Mr Barak, who was willing to offer much more to the Palestinians, failed so spectacularly. The execution of Mr Sharon's vague peace policies are also hostage to the kind of coalition he can muster in Israel's fractured parliament, or Knesset. By Israeli law, Mr Sharon must form a government by the end of March - 45 days after the publication of official poll results - or else the country faces new elections. Mr Sharon says he wants a national unity government with Mr Barak's Labour party. Israeli politicians who know Mr Sharon well, including the Nobel prize laureate, Shimon Peres, believe such a coalition could temper Israel's warrior. But if Mr Sharon forsakes a unity government for a narrow coalition with extreme rightwing parties, he could ditch his rosy campaign rhetoric and revert to earlier form. Mr Sharon's putative coalition partners from the far-right claim the bulky general would not hesitate to bomb Beirut and Cairo in case of attack. Such drastic action is in keeping with Mr Sharon's temperament. ""A single motif recurs throughout Sharon's military and political life: ""Always escalate"" writes Avishai Margalit, a philosophy professor at the Hebrew University in an essay on Mr Sharon. ""He believes that in the muddle resulting from an increase in violence he will always come out the winner. He will know how to create a situation in which people turn to him because he is self-confident and he knows what he wants."" Mr Sharon is Israel's original commando, the founder of the army's Unit 101, infamous for blowing up 69 people, half of them women and children, in a 1953 raid on the West Bank village of Qibya. In the 1970s, he relentlessly expanded Jewish settlements. As defence minister in 1982, he marched Israel's army all the way to Beirut, after assuring the cabinet that troops would only advance to within 40kms of the Lebanese border. He then allowed Christian militias to enter the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, in Beirut's southern suburbs, where they slaughtered 800 Palestinians. The atrocity forced Mr Sharon to resign, and a government commission said he was unfit to be defence minister. But voters demonstrated yesterday that they are willing to overlook Mr Sharon's bloody past at a time when the Palestinian uprising is killing their fellow Israelis on an almost daily basis. ""I voted for Ariel Sharon, and that is a vote for going to war,"" said artist Ariel-Regev Harari, a Barak voter who changed sides when he cast his vote in Jerusalem's genteel German Colony neighbourhood yesterday. ""But we are forced into going to war because of the situation. Here in Israel we are like sitting ducks."" Mr Sharon believes a final peace agreement with the Palestinians is impossible now. His recipe is simple: no negotiations with the Palestinians until the uprising ends. ""I will not hold negotiations under fire and terrorism and violence. That was Barak's mistake,"" he told the Ma'ariv newspaper. 'Painful concessions' Mr Sharon also wants the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to arrest all the ""terrorists"" who have led attacks on Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza. He wants a ban on ""incitement"" on the official Palestinian television and radio, and a total overhaul of Palestinian education, with textbooks preaching co-existence with Israel. Then, when Mr Sharon is eventually willing to talk peace, Mr Arafat will be stuck with the 42% of the West Bank he currently controls. Every Jewish trailer perched on lonely hilltops in the West Bank, or moored in sand dunes in the Gaza Strip, will stay put. There will be no concessions on Arab East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since the 1967 war. ""When I talk about painful concessions, I mean we will not reoccupy Nablus and Jericho and other places,"" he told an ultra-orthodox weekly newspaper. He also refuses to accept responsibility for the 3.7m registered Palestinian refugees who lost their homes when the Jewish state was created in 1948. In the unlikely event that the Palestinians are willing to accept those conditions then Mr Sharon is prepared to think about a Palestinian state. ""Over the years, we have to see how it develops,"" he said. ""Gradually, step by step, we might reach a peace agreement."" However, Mr Sharon does not have years - or even months. Palestinian officials have described Mr Sharon's policies as ""a declaration of war"", and in the West Bank and Gaza, the leaders of Mr Arafat's tanzim militia have called for an escalation of the uprising. ""The best way to deal with Sharon, the only way to deal with Sharon is the intifada and resistance,"" said Marwan Barghouti, a senior Fatah leader in the West Bank. With the Palestinians determined to test Mr Sharon from day one, Israel's old warrior will soon reveal his methods for ending an uprising that Mr Barak failed to contain with tanks, helicopter gunships and the assassination of Fatah commanders. Members of Mr Sharon's coterie say he is unlikely to indulge in the bombardments of Palestinian cities with which Mr Barak tried - and failed - to end the intifada. But he will tighten the ring of steel around Palestinian cities, and intensify restrictions on Palestinian travel in the West Bank. The key to fighting the intifada, Mr Sharon said during the campaign, is to put the Palestinian militias on the defensive ""from a situation in which they are engaged in planning how to take the lives of Jews and Israelis to the point where they will be forced to be totally preoccupied with how to save themselves."" On the ground, he can be expected to give army commanders a free hand against Palestinian gunmen, and to authorise assassinations of leading Palestinian figures - including members of Mr Arafat's administration - by Israeli hit squads. ""Sharon prefers non-conventional methods in which the unknown element will take the Palestinians by surprise,"" one of his confidants told Ma'ariv yesterday. Israelis are confident Mr Sharon can fight this uprising. But is he the man to end one? The best that he can offer is that he is a man who will not be pushed around. ""I know the Arabs, and the Arabs know me,"" Mr Sharon said repeatedly on the campaign trail. ""They know my word is my word, my yes is my yes and my no is my no. They know I mean what I say and I say what I think."" The next steps February 13 Knesset reconvenes. Mr Barak stays on as caretaker prime minister, while Mr Sharon tries to form a coalition from a fractured Knesset February 14 Publication of official election results. Mr Sharon has 45 days from this day to form a government February 28 Deadline for the appeal of the outcome March 31 Mr Sharon faces twin deadlines: he must present his government, with at least eight cabinet ministers, or the country faces new elections for prime minister and Knesset. New elections must be held in 60 days. This is also the last day for him to pass the budget; if he does not, the country faces a new general election in 60 days",2001-02-07T02:43:50Z,"{'polarity': -0.018433975321730432, 'subjectivity': 0.4510561150867273}",0.4510561150867273
world/2001/jan/14/spain.theobserver,Eta's loyal youth dreams of martyrdom and freedom,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/14/spain.theobserver,"Friday evening. In nearly all Bilbao's telephone booths the receivers have been ripped off - because the telephone company is Spanish. Cash dispensers have been smashed for a similar reason. The tension in the wet, narrow streets of the Basque city is palpable. 'Gora [long live] Eta!' screams the graffiti next to the pulverised money-machine. Here, three months ago, an Eta commando unit carrying 25 kilograms of dynamite accidentally blew itself up. One of them was 22 years old, another 23. Harriet Iragi (a man) was also 23 when he was arrested with his friend Jon Solana, 26, for killing an army doctor in Seville. They had shot the doctor in the face. The authorities suspect that Iragi and Solana, who were born in the old city centre of Bilbao a couple of doors from each other, were also involved in last summer's shootings of a public prosecutor in Granada and a city councillor from Malaga. Now their faces, looking like shiny pop stars, hang alongside those of a dozen other arrested activists above the bottles in Lariko, a bar in Bilbao. Igor, to whom I am talking, stares pensively for a moment at the pictures, then puts the change left over from the beers he ordered in a collection box for them. 'These people are all from this neighbourhood,' he says. Igor knows a few of them. 'Those four were murdered by the Spanish police,' he says, echoing the inflammatory rhetoric of the abertzale, the Basque patriot movement. According to its supporters, the Basque country is an occupied state, and the imprisoned members of Eta ( Euskadi Ta Askatasuna , or 'Basque Country and Freedom') are political prisoners. No region in the world enjoys such a high degree of self-government as the Basque country of Spain. It has its own regional rule, its own police and its own tax system - but Igor curses the Spanish identity card he has to carry. 'I am Basque, not Spanish. Believe me, as long as they don't acknowledge our rights, many more will die,' he warns, sipping his beer. He is far from unusual. A recent survey revealed that one in three Basque youths considers urban guerrilla tactics a good way to bring the 'foreign occupation' to its knees. One in 10 would not hesitate to use a weapon. The Lariko bar is crowded. Punk music blares in Euskera , the Basque language. The age of the average customer cannot be more than 24. They wear sweaters and mountaineering boots, and the girls show off their striking ponytails. 'Very pretty girls up here. Last summer we had some guys from Sinn Fein visiting us. They couldn't believe their eyes,' Igor says. 'At first, those guys from Belfast didn't understand it. It was not anything like Belfast. We don't have soldiers marching through the streets, tanks or any physical barriers, but at any moment streets might be closed off and riot police could enter the bar. They even use girls to infiltrate our movement.' Lariko is run by the radical nationalist party Herri Batasuna, the political backbone of Eta. In the last regional elections Herri Batasuna won 18 per cent of the votes. In other words, 223,262 Basques supported Eta's agenda. But that figure fails to reflect the support of those under the voting age. These youths join Haika, an Eta-led organisation that controls many separate groups. Haika is left-wing, anti-nuclear power, against Spain, in favour of squatters, feminism, conscientious objectors and the IRA. Harriet Iragi and Jon Solana are Haika products, as are all young recruits to Eta in the past decade. According to a study by the University of Bilbao, they are ordinary youths, aged between 15 and 26. The report says: 'They come from middle- and lower-middle-class backgrounds and are strongly influenced by the separatist ideology preached by the moderate nationalist parties. They believe violence is the only answer to the real oppression, exercised by an occupying force. As a result, they feel they have to do certain things.' Igor indignantly rejects the report's idea of a generation without any opportunity. 'It claims it is something new for young people to end up with Eta. Take Harriet Iragi for instance. He studied to become a technical engineer and was a nice bloke, timid even.' Four years ago, Iragi suddenly vanished after being released on bail following a petrol-bomb attack on a police patrol. 'So we all knew where Harriet had ended up.' Exactly what makes an engineering student attack a police patrol and end up with Eta, Igor can't say. 'One day, Eta just asks you.. and if they want you, you go.' A man and two women enter Lariko and are instantly surrounded. 'They are Harriet's parents and lawyer.' The latest news gets around: of how he has been put into isolation, and how a net has been stretched above the prison yard. 'Why did they do that?' a girl wants to know. 'So helicopters can't land,' the lawyer explains. 'Then why doesn't Harriet take the subway?' This remark sets off laughter in Lariko. Iragi's father looks weary. After a cat-and-mouse game in Seville, Iragi had surrendered to the police. 'He had partly undressed himself to prevent them thinking he was wearing a gun under his clothes and shooting him.' New laws are being prepared. 'In future, a minor may get up to 10 years for smashing telephones,' Igor growls. 'It'll only make the step to armed struggle easier. Before, you went as far as you felt like. But if they give you 10 years for a broken telephone booth, you might as well just kill someone.' When asked whether he would be prepared to go that far, Igor repeats his formula. 'If they want you, you go.' Under the heading 'Urban Terrorism', the Interior Ministry reported a 30 per cent increase in street vandalism last year. In the first half of 2000 the Ministry recorded 298 attacks, mostly incendiary bombs against public buildings and 'property of individuals'. In July a member of the ruling political party, the Partido Popular, had a Molotov cocktail thrown at the front of his house, and his horses were sprayed with ' Gora Eta!'. It is Saturday evening, and Igor has invited me to a party being thrown by the Basque patriotic students' union. On the way there he tells of the eight months he spent in prison after being arrested for acts of public disorder. He had a plastic bag put over his head until he choked, and he claims he is not the only one to have had such an experience. 'Nobody believes Basque prisoners are maltreated in Spanish prisons, but it definitely happens. Beatings, forcing your head in a bucket filled with water until you almost drown, humiliating people by questioning them while they are naked. Rapes.' In a June 1999 briefing, Amnesty International expressed its concerns about 'allegations of torture and ill-treatment' of Eta suspects. In several of these cases the accusations were supported by medical evidence, 'although other allegations were, by their nature, almost impossible to substantiate'. In the same briefing, Amnesty called on Eta to put an immediate end to its 'numerous violent and intimidating acts'. Rain falls mercilessly as we trudge around the muddy ground of the open-air party. It doesn't bother the thousands of cheerful students. A canvas, on which an axe and a snake are painted (Eta's coat of arms), is lying submerged in a pool of water on the path to one of the stages. Further on, two of Igor's female friends are drinking Cokes. Zaloa is 19, Irune, 21. 'You know how it is. Whenever I travel to Madrid, I don't find anything I can identify myself with. I always end up back here, in the Basque country,' Zaloa says. What most offends her are the tourists, walking through the streets of Bilbao, clapping to flamenco. 'I want them to recognise that I have my own culture.' The conversation shifts to the increase in the criminal penalties for minors. Irune shrugs. 'I don't know anybody who has not been fined. I know this guy who had to pay 50,000 pesetas [£180] for writing a slogan on a wall. That is not news to us. You're risking your life, so you have to be prepared.' Zaloa adds: 'They want to get rid of us, though I know I sound fanatical when I say so. But I am convinced the Basque country would have been wiped off the maps if Eta had not existed.' The singer with the band Su Tu Gar, playing ska, shouts: 'All police officers, remain on your feet!' As one, the audience hits the ground. As for the people killed by Eta, Zaloa bites her lips: 'I am dreadfully sorry for those people, but it is the only solution we have. That is the way it is.' But would she be prepared to meet someone and just kill him? Silence. 'Yes, I think I definitely would,' she says. Irune adds: 'Me, too. People would be surprised at what we are willing to do.' Driving back to Bilbao in the middle of the night, Igor explains: 'People would show up on my doorstep in the middle of the night, asking me if it was all right if they stayed with me. I never knew why they asked me, but I always agreed. Everybody knows someone who might be involved ... you never know. It's a risk you take.' The next afternoon, Sunday, in Abusu, a small town near Bilbao, Joseba Tzaga is being welcomed home. He has been in prison for four years for his involvement with Eta and is being received as a hero by about 200 fellow villagers. In return, he has some stirring words: 'If they think they can trample us down in their prisons, they are making a big mistake.' Aitor, a 21-year-old construction worker, applauds. He is wearing silver rings in both ears and an Adidas shirt. He spent a few days last summer in a squat in Amsterdam. 'Nice people, although they didn't understand our commitment to Basque independence at all. They confused nationalism with the things they saw in Serbia, something to do with the extreme right, and referring all the time to Nazism.' Aitor's eyes reflect his incredulity. 'They weren't aware at all of how we were fighting imperialism, just like in Holland.' Tzaga clenches his fist. 'We're going to win this fight!' Two people step forward, presenting him with a gift from the village. He waves it above his head. On a wooden shield, the axe and the snake are ingeniously carved. Under it, in the bleak afternoon sun, the letters of Eta glimmer. • This article appears in the current issue of the New Statesman",2001-01-14T00:08:10Z,"{'polarity': 0.05415877052240688, 'subjectivity': 0.4096963137872229}",0.4096963137872229
world/2001/jan/07/balkans,British safety claims wilt as uranium panic grips Nato,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/07/balkans,"Commandant Frank Cop is an angry man and a formidable opponent. A soldier in the Belgian army for 30 years, his career was cut short by illness two months after returning from duty as a peace monitor with the UN and the EU during the Bosnian war. In five years, says Cop, aged 50, he has been beset by a series of devastating ailments. He suffers headaches and muscle aches, debilitating lethargy and skin complaints so serious he finds it uncomfortable to bathe. Blood tests recorded abnormally high levels of white cells. Invalided out of the armed forces on a reduced pension, Cop embarked on a one-man campaign on behalf of Belgian veterans of the Balkans: victims, he claims, of a mysterious 'Balkans Syndrome', similar in its symptoms to the Gulf war Syndrome claimed by veterans of the war against Iraq. Cop is convinced he knows what has made him ill. He believes he was contaminated by the highly toxic residue from the three tonnes of depleted uranium (DU) ammunition fired by US aircraft against the Serbs during the Bosnian war. Last week Cop - one of the first peacekeepers to claim he was suffering from Balkans Syndrome - found himself at the centre of one of Nato's biggest peacetime crises, a scandal gripping the armed forces of a dozen European countries, as military chiefs across a continent ordered urgent checks on the health of soldiers allegedly exposed to depleted uranium in the Balkans. A week after the announcement by the Italian Defence Ministry that it was investigating the deaths from leukaemia of six of its Kosovo peacekeepers for links to depleted uranium, scores of former Balkans peacekeepers - from Hull to Lisbon - are now claiming they are suffering from unexplained ailments, as the media from Rome to Berlin has daily turned up new cases of peacekeepers who died from cancers after returning from the Balkans. In Britain two former peacekeepers have come forward, including former Royal Engineer Kevin Rudland, who believes he was contaminated servicing tank guns while based in the Bosnian Serb town of Banja Luka. His symptoms are ones that Cop would recognise immediately, most prominent among them chronic fatigue. 'After I became ill in August 1996 I was referred to the military medical services,' Cop said last week. 'My white blood cell count was three times what it should be. The military doctors said I was ill, but they did not know what from. 'That is when I began investigating for myself. I got in contact with a German doctor who had been studying the effects of depleted uranium in the Gulf and he told me American forces had used depleted uranium ammunition during the Bosnian war. The Americans denied it. Now they admit it's true.' In seven days the safety of the depleted uranium ammunition has become an international controversy, attracting competing charges of a US cover-up over the danger the ammunition poses and dangerous claims of 'scaremongering'. After a decade of inconclusive research had mostly ruled out any link between depleted uranium ammunition and cancers - and counter-claims alleging that it had caused thousands of cancers among Iraqi children - investigations into the health implications are suddenly under way in Belgium, Italy, France and Turkey; in Finland, Sweden, Portugal and Spain. Among those who have demanded an investigation are Italy's Prime Minister Giuliano Amato who has called for a US moratorium on the use of depleted uranium shells - rejected by the Pentagon - and EU Commission President Romano Prodi who called for the banning of the ammunition if even the slightest risk was identified. In response, Nato's Secretary-General Lord Robertson has promised the Italians to provide information on its use of the ammunition in the Balkans. Nato too will also discuss its safety at this week's meeting of Ministers. It is a scandal that threatens to take high profile victims. In Portugal the strength of feeling is so strong that it threatens to overshadow the presidential elections after the media reported claims that a Portuguese peacekeeper in Kosovo had died from ammunition poisoning. As more alleged victims emerged in Portugal, a heated emergency parliamentary debate saw MPs angrily calling for the withdrawal of Portuguese troops from the region, accusing the government of withholding information from them after the military claimed the soldier had died from septicaemia. In Kosovo, the claims have sparked a panic over fears among moderate Kosovar leaders that the scandal may lead to the withdrawal of peacekeeping contingents. In Britain, almost alone, the Ministry of Defence remains unmoved by the sense of panic gripping its European allies. The MoD's radiation and health experts, in step with the Pentagon, insist debris of depleted uranium poses little risk to the health of servicemen. They will read new research, they say, with interest and an open mind, but reject any calls for their own health screening of Balkan peacekeepers. Their hopes that the row might defuse, however, were shattered on Friday with the announcement by a UN Environment Programme task force that it had found evidence of 'radioactive contamination' at eight of 11 sites tested in Kosovo that were struck by depleted uranium ammunition during the war in 1999. It is a disclosure, however, that still does not answer a question that has become the centre of heated scientific debate - whether the reassurances of the British and American defence chiefs over the safety of depleted uranium can be sustained. Or whether they have seriously underestimated its danger. One organisation, at least is unconvinced, by their reassurances. On Friday the UN High Commissioner for Refugees confirmed its policy was to warn all staff travelling to Kosovo - and pregnant women in particular - of the potential risks of exposure to debris from depleted uranium still in the province. The answer to the question of whether depleted uranium ammunition is really safe may not lie in the bomb craters of Kosovo and Serbia. Instead, some experts believe, it is likely to be found in an area of barren Iraqi desert near the border with Kuwait, a place littered with remains of the last great land battle of the twentieth century - Operation Desert Storm. It was here that depleted uranium ammunition was used for the first time - more than 30 metric tonnes - 300,000 rounds in all. It is a landscape still dotted with the ruins of Iraqi tanks blasted with the ammunition, the rents in their armour still emitting tell-tale signs of low-level radiation. Significantly this battlefield represents an unintentional experiment - a decade in the making - over what happens to depleted uranium debris in the environment and how it affects the health of local populations. The most serious of those effects, the Iraqi authorities have long claimed, has been a sharp rise in childhood leukaemias and birth defects. And it was to here that British low-level radiation specialist Dr Chris Busby travelled three months ago to perform a radiological survey for an Arab television station. What Busby discovered surprised him. Soil samples - confiscated by the Iraqi authorities - showed lower levels of contamination than he expected. But his air samples revealed levels of ionising radiation in the atmosphere around the battlefield 10 times higher than in the neighbouring city of Basra and 20 times higher than in Baghdad. If his samples are correct, then US and British military claims that microscopic breathable particles of depleted uranium quickly disperse might not be true. It is this that is at the centre of the present controversy. What is accepted by all sides is that when depleted uranium ammunition - used in bullets for its hardness and penetrating power - hits its target, it also explodes and burns at temperatures of up to 10,000 C forming a smoke or 'aerosol' of suspended particles composed of three toxic and radioactive compounds of uranium. But, according to US and British defence experts, the only risk is to those in the vicinity of the battlefield in the immediate aftermath of the attack who breathe in concentrations of the aerosol of compounds. The risk, they claim decreases, as the aerosol disperses to levels of risk below that acceptable within the civil nuclear industry. According to these calculations there should be no contamination of Iraq's air and little risk. Busby, however, believes that the MoD's experts have got it wrong on two counts: on the way that charged, contaminated particles remain in the environment and - more seriously - over their risk models which he claims are outdated and underestimate the health impact by up to 1,000-fold, a claim he made in a paper to the Royal Society's Depleted Uranium working group last year. Busby is not alone in believing the MoD may have got it wrong. Professor Malcolm Hooper, a member of the British Legion's Gulf War Illnesses Inter-Parliamentary group, also believes the advice given by health experts of the British and US military is dangerously out of date. 'New research suggests the risk threshold from inhaled particles is much, much lower than previously assumed,' he said. Hooper points to research suggesting that genetic mutation to irradiated cell tissue takes place in a more pernicious way than previously assumed, with 35 per cent of cells neighbouring a single irradiated one showing evidence of damage. The most controversial piece of research, however, has been undertaken in Newfoundland, Canada, where scientists at the International Uranium Centre tested the urine of British, US and Canadian Gulf war veterans, as well as that of Iraqi veterans and civilians, using for the first time Thermal Ionising Mass Spectrometry. They detected traces of depleted uranium in their urine. The Ministry of Defence is sceptical about the work of both Busby and the International Uranium Centre, led by Professor Asaf Durakovic and Dr Patricia Horan, pointing instead to a US study by the Baltimore Veteran Affairs department of 33 American veterans who survived so-called 'friendly fire' incidents involving depleted uranium ammunition. 'These people have considerable amounts of depleted uranium in their bodies in the form of shrapnel, and excrete high levels of uranium in their urine,' said an MoD source. 'Significantly none of them of has shown significant problems, nor have their children.' Frank Cop and the other victims are not going to be convinced. • Additional reporting by Emma Daly in Madrid and Eduardo Goncalves in Lisbon",2001-01-07T01:10:40Z,"{'polarity': 0.030656050298907445, 'subjectivity': 0.4344808630522915}",0.4344808630522915
world/2001/apr/18/mayday.features11,Profile of American anarchist John Zerzan,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/18/mayday.features11,"John Zerzan is sweeping the porch of his small cabin-style home in the university town of Eugene, Oregon. It is a glorious, spring, cherry blossom day, and it is hard to imagine that the slight, bearded soul in khaki shorts and a T-shirt bearing the legend ""What goes up must come down"" is really the bete noire of technology and capitalism, the man regarded by the Wall Street Journal as a cross between Fagin and the Antichrist. Zerzan is an anarchist author who believes that our culture is on a death march and that technology in all its forms must be resisted. He corresponds and sympathises with Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber. He believes that civilisation has been a failure and that the system is fast collapsing, and he has been blamed by some for the mayhem at the Battle of Seattle in 1999. This weekend, when it hosts the Free Trade Area of the Americas talks, Quebec City becomes the latest magnet for international protest and a focus for many who are attracted to Zerzan's views. Zerzan seems puzzled by the attention that he and his beliefs, encapsulated in his books Future Primitive and Elements of Refusal, are now receiving. The spotlight first shone on him in 1997 when it emerged that he had visited the Unabomber in jail and that the two shared many beliefs. Kaczynski is serving three life sentences for mail-bomb murders over a 17-year period and is now in a maximum-security prison in Florence, 100 miles south of Denver. ""Unless the revolution gets there, he's there for ever,"" says Zerzan. ""He is in very restricted quarters. For one who found his happiness in nature, you've got to assume that it's awfully hard to live that way. Will there be other Kaczynskis? I hope not. I think that activity came out of isolation and desperation, and I hope that isn't going to be something that people feel they have to take up because they have no other way to express their opposition to the brave new world."" Interest in Zerzan and his own opposition to that brave new world intensified after Seattle and will doubtless do so again if there is trouble in Quebec City this weekend, although he will not be there personally. ""We got some some credit - or notoriety - over Seattle and a number of us were there, but it's not our priority to be dashing around. I think the question now is whether mass street protests have a big future. Will we go through the ritual of these pre-planned situations in the streets where people get arrested or should we put our energy elsewhere?"" Of Czech origin on both sides of his family, Zerzan grew up in Salem, Oregon. He took degrees in political science at Stanford and history at San Francisco State, then, after a stint as an organiser with a union of social services employees, took postgraduate studies at the University of Southern California. He was active in conventional leftwing politics and was arrested in 1966 for demonstrating against the Vietnam war. Nearly 20 years ago he moved north to Eugene, which has since become something of an anarchist stronghold, with fierce battles fought against gentrification and development. In June 1999, not long before Seattle, a march following a two-day anarchist conference in Eugene led to a bloody riots and arrests. One anarchist was jailed for seven years for assaulting police with a rock. As one would expect there is no car outside Zerzan's home - he cycles. There are no credit cards in his wallet, nor computers on his desk. He has financed his writing by selling his own blood plasma, but now makes his living doing odd jobs and babysitting. He is working on a ""mini memoir"". His books are accessible, his frames of reference encompassing everyone from Robert Louis Stevenson and William Morris to Jean Baudrillard and Euclid. He does volunteer work with disabled people in the weights rooms of the local YMCA and has a programme on KWVA, the local campus station, on which he plays everything from classical to hip hop. He lives in a housing cooperative, of which he is currently the president: ""I get a lot of grief for that - 'Mr Anarchist President'."" He was married and has a daughter, whose picture sits on a shelf in his modest front room with its chess board and shelves of books. Zerzan has been described by critics as one of those anarchists who ""carry a black flag in one hand and a welfare cheque in the other"", to which he replies that he doesn't know anyone on welfare. He is also often portrayed as part of the ""hunter-gatherer"" wing of anarchism, so how would he describe his views? ""It's the effort to understand and do away with every form of domination, and that involves questioning very basic institutions, including the division of labour and domestication upon which the whole edifice of civilisation and technology rests ... If you took away division of labour and domestication you might have something pretty close to what obtained for the first two million years of the species, during which there was leisure time, there was quite a lot of gender equality and no organised violence - which doesn't sound too bad. They say: 'Oh, you want to be a caveman.' Well, maybe that's somewhat true."" He says that he got used to ""the whole primitivist thing"" being used in quotation marks and that it makes him cringe. ""Now I guess the quotes are off, but all of these labels seem like the same old 'I'm a this and I'm a that'. In America it's very, very popular to be 'anti-ideological'. Everyone says: 'Oh, I'm not ideological.' When Americans say they're not ideological, it just means they accept the basic system or that they're not political."" Some of the protesters at Seattle took issue with Zerzan and the young, black-clad Eugene anarchists who smashed windows. One liberal Seattle commentator said he would have spat in Zerzan's face after the riots if he had seen him because the wrecked shop fronts had detracted from the main business of closing down the World Trade Organisation talks. Zerzan replies: ""It took Seattle to break the ice. The fact that people got out there and rumbled. You can hold up signs at demos and little rallies and that'll do nothing. I wish good ideas would just wonderfully work their magic but good ideas are worth nothing if you can't back it up."" But it is specifically his voicing of opposition to new technologies that has brought him prominence, with detractors and admirers. ""The idea of technology being a neutral, discreet thing and whoever is in charge can use it this way or that way, that's really missing the point. It's inseparable from the system, it's the incarnation of the system and it's always been that way. You can't take a totally alienating technology and use it for anything except more alienation, more destructive impact on every level from the psyche to the rest of the biosphere. Globalisation is a kind of buzz word at the moment and once again the lefties have come up with a soft core thing. Globalisation is nothing new; what's happening now is just the latest round of excesses."" Zerzan says he objects to being portrayed as someone leading an army of young anarchists into battle. ""People think I'm trying to push everybody into wild stuff but I'm more worried about people staying out of jail. This is not a game. There has been some heavy stuff already and there will be more."" He always disagreed with Kaczynski on the issue of violence against living creatures and says that the same is true of his fellow anarchists in Eugene and of the Earth Liberation Front, which has recently been burning down properties built as part of an urban sprawl. ""Property destruction as a tactic is a totally different thing and we're way in favour of that, but that is not violence."" But if Zerzan has been the butt of attacks from the conservative media, he also has few friends on the organised left. ""One of my pet peeves is that the left shows no interest in these things. It deserves to go extinct. It is never going to extend or deepen its critique and that's fine with me because it's kind of an albatross and it's failed so deeply."" He does not, he says, ""throw out all of Marx, the class struggle, all that we take for granted"". But he includes in his condemnation ""liberals, Marxists, members of left parties, Noam Chomsky, the anarchist left, the syndicalists, the Wobblies, all those people who think technology is fine and it just depends on how you use it and that there's nothing wrong with development and the industrial system, it just depends who's running it."" He is aware of the contradiction of a movement that despises hierarchies having one figure who is becoming as prominent as he is. ""I'm not handling this well - if you have one person all over the place that really is in contradiction to the anarchy idea, so we're trying to get away from that, but here we are! I'm always speaking for myself - I'm not speaking for all anarchists."" But is it not the case that much of the protest movement now is fuelled by communication on the internet in a way that would otherwise be impossible? ""That's another of the contradictions. It is true, for example, that many more people have read my stuff [on the internet] than have bought the books, and that's fine ... Many people I know do use it for instant communication, for coordinating things. You can get anarchist news daily in 12 languages on what is going on today in Greece or wherever and that is an obvious service. I don't even have a computer, but I think you can use it without succumbing to it."" He does have a television set, and contributes to the underground Radio Free Cascadia and cable access shows. ""Everyone needs to veg out at times and television's not as bad as hard drugs."" There is an ongoing debate, he says, about whether one should even bother talking to the media. Three years earlier, he says, the Wall Street Journal had come to Eugene and talked to everybody, including the parents of many of the younger anarchists, and had then written ""the most scurrilous, inaccurate article. I still marvel at it. All false stuff about how these kids were all runaways and how they were going to set bombs, just nutty stuff ... Some people wouldn't talk to you or anyone from the straight media, just wouldn't do it. Some of us argue that people can read between the lines and if they cut the thing or if it's somewhat spun, people understand."" He has recently been in Europe, in Spain and England, and the trip has enthused him. ""More and more people are ready for some movement that is pitched at a deeper level. I was kind of surprised at how many people wanted to talk about Seattle ... I don't want to dwell on Seattle and yet that was an inspiring thing around the world, the opening battle of a new movement, so to speak."" He sees the spate of school shootings and the the vast increase in teenage suicides in America as a sign of a system reaching breaking point: ""There are even higher incidents of homicide at work; that didn't happen when I was a kid. My dad was an NRA [National Rifle Association] lifetime kind of guy and we had all kinds of guns in our house, but no one dreamed of taking a gun to school ... Travelling around, boy, I think people are so fed up with things. On the train last August I was overhearing all kinds of things. People were talking about how bugged they are - they've got their beepers and their cellphones, they don't have a second's rest any more - and these were just straight people."" He abhors what he sees as a world in which much of someone's day is spent gazing through a screen - a TV screen, a computer screen, a car windscreen. But while it is not hard to imagine returning to utopian simplicity on a gorgeous day in Eugene, where the Red Barn Organic Grocery noticeboard offers handmade moccasins and didgeridoo sound therapy, what relevance does all the theory really have for someone living in the middle of Detroit or east Los Angeles? ""It's a huge challenge,"" Zerzan admits. ""You 've got these great grandiose ideas, but the rubber has to hit the road somewhere, and we know that. I don't know how that's going to work."" He cites small movements such as Food not Bombs, guerrilla gardening and Cafe Anarchista, and praises magazines such as Adbusters, Anarchy Magazine, Fifth Estate and the Earth First Journal. ""But we are a long way from connecting with that reality and we have to face that. You start off with questioning things and trying to enlarge the space where people can have dialogue and raise the questions that are not being raised anywhere else. But we don't have blueprints as to what people should do."" He is not alone in his disquiet. Last year, in a fascinating treatise in Wired, Bill Joy, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems, one of whose friends was a victim of Kaczynski, said that although he believed that the Unabomber's actions had been criminally insane, there had been some merit in the case he made against a headlong technological rush to the future. He and Zerzan have since corresponded. Zerzan comes to the porch to bid farewell. A cat is chasing a squirrel. The squirrel escapes. ""They always get away,"" says Zerzan admiringly as the untamed, free-spirited creature runs rings around its domesticated pursuer.

world/2001/feb/24/pinochet.bookextracts,The Trials of Henry Kissinger,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/24/pinochet.bookextracts,"On December 2, 1998, Mr Michael Korda was being interviewed on camera in his office at Simon &amp; Schuster. As one of the reigning magnates of New York publishing, he had edited and ""produced"" the work of authors as various as Tennessee Williams, Richard Nixon and Joan Crawford. On this particular day, he was talking about the life and thoughts of the singer Cher, whose portrait adorned the wall behind him. And then the telephone rang and there was a message to call ""Dr"" Henry Kissinger as soon as possible. A polymath like Mr Korda knows - what with the exigencies of publishing in these vertiginous days - how to switch in an instant between Cher and high statecraft. The camera kept running, and recorded the following scene for a tape which I possess. Asking his secretary to get the number (759 7919 - the digits of Kissinger Associates), Mr Korda quips drily, to general laughter in the office, that it ""should be 1-800-cambodia . . . 1-800-bomb-cambodia"". After a pause of nicely calibrated duration (no senior editor likes to be put on hold while he's receiving company, especially media company), it's ""Henry - Hi, how are you? . . . You're getting all the publicity you could want in the New York Times, but not the kind you want . . . I also think it's very, very dubious for the administration to simply say yes, they'll release these papers . . . no . . . no, absolutely . . . no . . . no . . . well, hmmm, yeah. We did it until quite recently, frankly, and he did prevail . . . Well, I don't think there's any question about that, as uncomfortable as it may be . . . Henry, this is totally outrageous . . . yeah . . . Also the jurisdiction. This is a Spanish judge appealing to an English court about a Chilean head of state. So it's, it . . . Also Spain has no rational jurisdiction over events in Chile anyway so that makes absolutely no sense . . . Well, that's probably true . . . If you would. I think that would be by far and away the best . . . Right, yeah, no I think it's exactly what you should do and I think it should be long and I think it should end with your father's letter. I think it's a very important document . . . Yes, but I think the letter is wonderful, and central to the entire book. Can you let me read the Lebanon chapter over the weekend?"" At this point the conversation ends, with some jocular observations by Mr Korda about his upcoming colonoscopy: ""a totally repulsive procedure"". By means of the same tiny internal camera, or its forensic equivalent, one could deduce not a little about the world of Henry Kissinger from this microcosmic exchange. The first and most important thing is this. Sitting in his office at Kissinger Associates, with its tentacles of business and consultancy stretching from Belgrade to Beijing, and cushioned by innumerable other directorships and boards, he still shudders when he hears of the arrest of a dictator. Syncopated the conversation with Mr Korda may be, but it's clear that the keyword is ""jurisdiction"". What had the New York Times been reporting that fine morning? On that December 2, 1998, its front page carried the following report from Tim Weiner, the paper's national security correspondent in Washington. Under the headline ""US Will Release Files On Crimes Under Pinochet"", he wrote: Treading into a political and diplomatic confrontation it tried to avoid, the United States decided today to declassify some secret documents on the killings and torture committed during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile . . . The decision to release such documents is the first sign that the United States will cooperate in the case against General Pinochet. Clinton Administration officials said they believed the benefits of openness in human rights cases outweighed the risks to national security in this case. But the decision could open ""a can of worms"", in the words of a former Central Intelligence Agency [CIA] official stationed in Chile, exposing the depth of the knowledge that the United States had about crimes charged against the Pinochet government . . . While some European government officials have supported bringing the former dictator to court, United States officials have stayed largely silent, reflecting skepticism about the Spanish court's power, doubts about international tribunals aimed at former foreign rulers, and worries over the implications for American leaders who might someday also be accused in foreign countries. President Richard M Nixon and Henry A Kissinger, who served as his national security advisor and Secretary of State, supported a right-wing coup in Chile in the early 1970s, previously declassified documents show. But many of the actions of the United States during the 1973 coup, and much of what American leaders and intelligence services did in liaison with the Pinochet government after it seized power, remain under the seal of national security. The secret files on the Pinochet regime are held by the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the State Department, the Pentagon, the National Security Council, the National Archives, the Presidential libraries of Gerald R Ford and Jimmy Carter, and other government agencies. According to Justice Department records, these files contain a history of human rights abuses and international terrorism: • In 1975 State Department officials in Chile protested the Pinochet regime's record of killing and torture, filing dissents to American foreign policy with their superiors in Washington. • The CIA has files on assassinations by the regime and the Chilean secret police. The intelligence agency also has records on Chile's attempts to establish an international right-wing covert-action squad. • The Ford Library contains many of Mr Kissinger's secret files on Chile, which have never been made public. Through a secretary, Mr Kissinger declined a request for an interview today. One must credit Kissinger with grasping what so many other people did not: that if the Pinochet precedent became established, then he himself was in some danger. The United States believes that it alone pursues and indicts war criminals and ""international terrorists""; nothing in its political or journalistic culture yet allows for the thought that it might be harbouring and sheltering such a senior one. Yet the thought had very obliquely surfaced in Mr Weiner's story, and Kissinger was a worried man when he called his editor that day to discuss a memoir (eventually published under the unbearably dull and self-regarding title Years Of Renewal) that was still in progress. ""Harbouring and sheltering"", though, are understatements for the lavishness of Henry Kissinger's circumstances. His advice is sought, at $25,000 an appearance, by audiences of businessmen and academics and policymakers. His turgid newspaper column is syndicated by the Los Angeles Times. His first volume of memoirs was part written and also edited by Harold Evans, who with Tina Brown is among the many hosts and hostesses who solicit Kissinger's company, or perhaps, one should say, society, for those telling New York soirées. At different times, he has been a consultant to ABC News and CBS; his most successful diplomacy, indeed, has probably been conducted with the media (and his single greatest achievement has been to get almost everybody to call him ""Doctor""). Fawned on by Ted Koppel, sought out by corporations and despots with ""image"" problems or ""failures of communication"", and given respectful attention by presidential candidates and those whose task it is to ""mould"" their global vision, this man wants for little in the pathetic universe that the ""self-esteem"" industry exists to serve. Of whom else would Norman Podhoretz write, in a bended-knee encomium to Years Of Upheaval: What we have here is writing of the very highest order. It is writing that is equally at ease in portraiture and abstract analysis; that can shape a narrative as skilfully as it can paint a scene; that can achieve marvels of compression while moving at an expansive and leisurely pace. It is writing that can shift without strain or falsity of tone from the gravitas befitting a book about great historical events to the humor and irony dictated by an unfailing sense of human proportion. A critic who can suck like that, as was once drily said by one of my moral tutors, need never dine alone. And nor need his subject. Except that, every now and then, the recipient (and donor) of so much sycophancy feels a tremor of anxiety. He leaves the well-furnished table and scurries to the bathroom. Is it perhaps another disclosure on a newly released Nixon tape? Some stray news from Indonesia, portending the fall or imprisonment of another patron (and perhaps the escape of an awkward document or two)? The arrest or indictment of a torturer or assassin, the expiry of the statute of secrecy for some obscure cabinet papers in a faraway country - any one of these can instantly spoil his day. As we see from the Korda tape, Kissinger cannot open the morning paper with the assurance of tranquillity. Because he knows what others can only suspect, or guess at. He knows. And he is a prisoner of the knowledge as, to some extent, are we. Notice the likeable way in which Mr Korda demonstrates his broadmindedness with the Cambodia jest. Everybody ""knows"", after all, that Kissinger inflicted terror and misery and mass death on that country, and great injury to the United States Constitution at the same time. (Everybody also ""knows"" that other vulnerable nations can lay claim to the same melancholy and hateful distinction, with incremental or ""collateral"" damage to American democracy keeping pace.) Yet the pudgy man standing in black tie at the Vogue party is not, surely, the man who ordered and sanctioned the destruction of civilian populations, the assassination of inconvenient politicians, the kidnapping and disappearance of soldiers and journalists and clerics who got in his way? Oh, but he is. It's exactly the same man. And that may be among the most nauseating reflections of all. Kissinger is not invited and feted because of his exquisite manners or his mordant wit (his manners are in any case rather gross, and his wit consists of a quiver of borrowed and secondhand darts). No, he is sought after because his presence supplies a frisson: the authentic touch of raw and unapologetic power. There's a slight guilty nervousness on the edge of Mr Korda's gag about the indescribable sufferings of Indochina. And I've noticed, time and again standing at the back of the audience during Kissinger speeches, that laughter of the nervous, uneasy kind is the sort of laughter he likes to provoke. In exacting this tribute, he flaunts not the ""aphrodisiac"" of power (another of his plagiarised bons mots) but its pornography. In a famous expression of his contempt for democracy, Kissinger once observed that he saw no reason why a certain country should be allowed to ""go Marxist"" merely because ""its people are irresponsible"". The country concerned was Chile, which at the time of this remark had a justified reputation as the most highly evolved pluralistic democracy in the southern hemisphere of the Americas. The pluralism translated, in the years of the Cold War, into an electorate that voted about one-third conservative, one-third socialist and communist, and one-third Christian Democratic and centrist. This had made it relatively easy to keep the Marxist element from having its turn in government, and ever since 1962 the CIA had - as it had in Italy and other comparable nations - largely contented itself with funding the reliable elements. In September 1970, however, the Left's candidate actually gained a slight plurality of 36.2% in the presidential elections. Divisions on the Right, and the adherence of some smaller radical and Christian parties to the Left, made it a moral certainty that the Chilean Congress would, after the traditional 60-day interregnum, confirm Dr Salvador Allende as the next president. But the very name of Allende was anathema to the extreme Right in Chile, to certain powerful corporations (notably ITT, Pepsi Cola and the Chase Manhattan Bank) which did business in Chile and the United States, and to the CIA. This loathing quickly communicated itself to President Nixon. He was personally beholden to Donald Kendall, the president of Pepsi Cola, who had given him his first corporate account when, as a young lawyer, he had joined John Mitchell's New York firm. A series of Washington meetings, held within 11 days of Allende's electoral victory, essentially settled the fate of Chilean democracy. After discussions with interested parties, and with CIA director Richard Helms, Kissinger went with Helms to the Oval Office. Helms's notes of the meeting show that Nixon wasted little breath in making his wishes known. Allende was not to assume office. ""Not concerned risks involved. No involvement of embassy. $10,000,000 available, more if necessary. Full-time job - best men we have . . . Make the economy scream. 48 hours for plan of action."" Declassified documents show that Kissinger - who had previously neither known nor cared about Chile, describing it offhandedly as ""a dagger pointed at the heart of Antarctica"" - took seriously this chance to impress his boss. A group was set up in Langley, Virginia, with the express purpose of running a ""two track"" policy for Chile: one the ostensible diplomatic one and the other - unknown to the State Department or the US ambassador to Chile, Edward Korry - a strategy of destabilisation, kidnap and assassination, designed to provoke a military coup. There were long- and short-term obstacles to the incubation of such an intervention, especially in the brief interval available before Allende took his oath of office. The long-term obstacle was the tradition of military abstention from politics in Chile, a tradition which marked off the country from its neighbours. Such a military culture was not to be degraded overnight. The short-term obstacle lay in the person of one man - General René Schneider. As chief of the Chilean General Staff, he was adamantly opposed to any military meddling in the electoral process. Accordingly, it was decided at a meeting on September 18, 1970, that General Schneider had to go. The plan was to have him kidnapped by extremist officers, in such a way as to make it appear that leftist and pro-Allende elements were behind the plot. The resulting confusion, it was hoped, would panic the Chilean Congress into denying Allende the presidency. A sum of $50,000 was offered around the Chilean capital, Santiago, for any officer or officers enterprising enough to take on this task. Richard Helms and his director of covert operations, Thomas Karamessines, told Kissinger that they were not optimistic. Military circles were hesitant and divided, or else loyal to General Schneider and the Chilean constitution. As Helms put it in a later account of the conversation, ""We tried to make clear to Kissinger how small the possibility of success was."" Kissinger firmly told Helms and Karamessines to press on in any case. Here one must pause for a recapitulation. An unelected official in the United States is meeting with others, without the knowledge or authorisation of Congress, to plan the kidnapping of a constitution-minded senior officer in a democratic country with which the United States is not at war, and with which it maintains cordial diplomatic relations. The minutes of the meetings may have an official look to them (though they were hidden from the light of day for long enough) but what we are reviewing is a ""hit"" - a piece of state-supported terrorism.
